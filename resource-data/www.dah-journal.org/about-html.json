    "description": "International Journal for Digital Art History. The peer reviewed journal seeks to gather current developments in the field of Digital Art History world-wide and to foster discourse on the subject both from Art History and Information Science. The Digital Age has revolutionized economy, society and our private lives. For decades now, digitalization has also touched most branches of the humanities. With the rising importance of the so called Digital Humanities, Art History is at the brink of new ways of accessing its material and gaining unprecedented insights. Many approaches are currently evolving in the international sphere of Art History and many questions still remain unanswered: What requirements does Art History have towards Information Technology? What projects do exist that can serve as best practice? Which direction does Art History go from here? How can we build an international community to reach our shared goals in research?. Thus, the \"International Journal of Digital Art History\" (DAH) gives authors in this field the opportunity to reach a wider audience, spark a discussion on the future of our discipline and generate an international and interdisciplinary network of scholars and practitioners. The journal is edited in order to gather articles around a common theme in each issue. In addition it is peer reviewd by at least two reviewers in a double-blind process. It is published online and in print. Contributions are welcome. For information on the current Call for Manuscripts and further details for authors, please see the respective pages on this website.
