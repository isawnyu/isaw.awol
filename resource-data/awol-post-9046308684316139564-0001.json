    "description": "Giza 3D is a complex project, involving collaboration, and management of a huge wealth of data in an attractive, realistic and user-friendly presentation. It is a perfect demonstration of the power of 3D in the service of specialized research on the one hand, and the sharing of knowledge with all types of people on the other.For the first time, the latest and most exhaustive information available on the Giza Necropolis will be made available to everyone through a realistic experience that can satisfy mere cu- riosity or encourage more demanding research inquiries.Who knows, we may even find the next George Reisner among the visitors to Giza 3D.Download the press kit",
