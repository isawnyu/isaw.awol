    "description": "Introduction... Our goal for these pages is to collect, organize, and annotate as many of the fundamental works of Syriac scholarship that are to be found freely available online. We believe firmly that the free and open access of scholarly materials should be encouraged and will be a fundamental, non-negotiable cornerstone of future scholarship. All of the books linked herein are (to our best knowledge) out of copyright and hosted by digital storehouses like Google, Archive.org, and Hathi Trust. We hope to expand the number of items we link to as more resources become freely available. Our ultimate aim is to make as much information and as many resources pertaining to Syriac studies freely and easily available to as many people as possible. We would be thrilled if this site would also serve to promote the grander cause of open access scholarship. Please feel free to get in touch with us if you have suggestions, comments, or questions about the site.
