    "description": "The Ancient Cyprus Web Project The Ancient Cyprus Web Project is a new venture in scholarship and knowledge-sharing. It offers the opportunity for people with all levels of experience to participate, from undergraduates and knowledgeable amateurs to the most senior figures in archaeological research. We are building a website that will provide information such as extensive bibliographies, sources of funding, centres of study, lists of collections and access arrangements, scholar and project contact details, bulletins on excavations and projects, and excavation reports. Major archaeological topics will be introduced by straightforward essays, and guidance given on further reading. Home",
