    "description": "%IMAGEREPLACED% Robert Ousterhout, Renata Holod, and Lothar Haselberger, editors Arthur Thourson Jones, associate editor Publication date: October 2012 University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA This symposium (original Program of Speakers and poster ) assembled specialists in various fields to examine building practices in the pre-modern world, with an emphasis on aspects of construction and structure in ancient Greek, Roman, Byzantine, medieval, and early-to-middle period Islamic architecture. While some technologies and built forms may be shared across pre-modern cultures (such as vault construction or the use of centering), other may be specific to a single period or region (such as the use of concrete or structural ribs in vaulting). Papers examined the problems pre-modern masons commonly encountered\u2014and the solutions they developed\u2014in the process of design and construction.
