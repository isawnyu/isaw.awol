    "description": "On the morning of Friday, September 4, 1998, the Numismatic Bibliomania Society's Internet email list was inaugurated with the following message: This message is being sent to members and friends of the Numismatic Bibliomania Society (NBS)In a Press Release going out soon to the numismatic press, we describe the purpose of the mailing list as follows:\u00a0 \u00a0 Numismatic Bibliomania Society Vice President Wayne Homren is collecting email addresses for NBS members,\u00a0 a process which began at the national meeting at the Portland\u00a0 ANA convention. The resulting mailing list will be used to keep members and interested parties updated on NBS events and\u00a0 changes to the NBS web site (http://www.money.org/club_nbs.html).\u00a0 \u00a0 A number of folks signed up at the meeting in Portland.\u00a0 To that initial group we've added the addresses of other current and former members that the Board is aware of, plus a few numismatic pen pals we thought might be interested.\u00a0 This is intended to be a moderated, low-volume mailing list, with no more than one message every week or so.\u00a0 Its purpose and use will evolve over time - please send us your comments and suggestions.\u00a0 In the meantime, please visit our web site, and forward this\u00a0 note to any other email pen-pal you think might have an interest. Remember, the list isn't limited to only NBS members.\u00a0 Don't assume they're already on the list;\u00a0 we're starting small, but with your help we can grow.\u00a0\u00a0The Esylum Volume IndexVolume 11998Volume 21999Volume 32000Volume 42001Volume 52002Volume 62003Volume 72004Volume 82005Volume 92006Volume 102007Volume 112008Volume 122009Volume 132010Volume 142011E-Sylum Complete Table of Contents",
