    "description": "Corpus of Ancient South Arabian Minuscule texts (work in progress) This is a small corpus, comprising some 40 texts, written in a new script and on a different support than the inscriptions in monumental writing engraved on stone, bronze or rocks. The first two wooden sticks texts were discovered at the beginning of the 1970's, during clandestine excavations in as-Sawd\u0101\u02be. The scholar Mahmoud al-Ghul was the first to partially decipher these new documents. COLLECTIONS BY DEPOSIT",
