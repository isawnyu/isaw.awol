    "description": "Corpus of Sabaic Inscriptions (work in progress) The Corpus of Sabaic inscriptions is the largest linguistic corpus of South Arabian texts. To date, of the approximately 5,000 Sabaic inscriptions, 1,800 have been published in DASI. This corpus is divided into three major historical linguistic periods: early, middle and late. We have also identified a number of regional varieties such as the Corpus of Early Sabaic inscriptions from Ethiopia and in - the Middle phase - the Central, Northern and Southern Sabaic. %IMAGEREPLACED% Corpus of Undefined Ancient South Arabian Language inscriptions (work in progress) This corpus collects all the South Arabian texts which cannot be assigned to any specific language, because they convey no information about their linguistic provenance, nor on their geographic or chronological setting. The majority of them are fragmentary or simply onomastic texts.",
