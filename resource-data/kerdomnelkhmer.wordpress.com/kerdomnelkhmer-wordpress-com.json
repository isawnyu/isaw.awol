    "description": "Kerdomnel Khmer Magazine. KERDOMNEL KHMER (Khmer Heritage) is the first magazine in the Kingdom of Cambodia which focuses on arts, archaeology, history, epigraphy, ethnology, sociology,painting, cultural tourism, and so on. The magazine, of which a trial issue has now been published, will also provide information to readers on exhibitions, meetings, workshops, and publications on the arts and archaeology in Southeast Asia and countries around the world. The people involved in founding and researching for KERDOMNEL KHMER Magazine are local and international professors and students, both within and outside the country, who are conducting projects on archaeology, architecture, history, sociology, cultural tourism, and publishing. The magazine will be used to spread information and share news to readers, especially the younger generation and persons in regional areas. It is intended to educate people in the importance of cultural legacy and national heritage in order to promote conservation and protection. To facilitate understanding by a wide range of readers, the published articles will be simply written and will try to avoid unnecessary technical terms. All data and information related to our project will be hosted at www. kerdomnel-khmer. org. While the magazine has its own researchers to call on, we will also welcome any articles related to Khmer culture and civilization by researchers who wish to publish in our magazine, and we will also welcome any feedback from our reader through a \"Letters to the Editor\" section.
