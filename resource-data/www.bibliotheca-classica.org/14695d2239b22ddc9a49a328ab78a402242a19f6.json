    "description": "Hyperboreus: Bibliotheca Classica Petropolitana. ISSN: 0949-2615. Hyperboreus was founded by the Bibliotheca classica Petropolitana in 1994 as the first academic journal in Russia since the 1917 revolution specializing in the field of classical studies. Scholars from the Classical Department of St. Petersburg State University, the St. Petersburg Institute of History (Russian Academy of Sciences) and St. Petersburg classical Gymnasium participated in the foundation of the journal. The editors value highly the support and advice of many Western European and American scholars during the foundation and subsequent activities of Hyperboreus. The aims of Hyperboreus are to advance the study of classical antiquity in Russia and to encourage international cooperation in this field by publishing original articles and reviews of books in Russian, English, German, French, Italian, and Latin. The editors invite contributions in all areas of classical scholarship (language and literature, history, philosophy and sciences, papyrology, epigraphy, archaeology, arts) based primarily on the interpretation of classical sources. Hyperboreus also aims at throwing light upon archaeological excavations of the classical sites on the Northern coast of the Black Sea region.",
