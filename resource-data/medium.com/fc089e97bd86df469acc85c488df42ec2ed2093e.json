    "description": "Eidolon: A Modern Way to Write about the Ancient World. Eidolon is a home for scholarly writing about Classics that isn\u2019t formal scholarship. Our goal is to create a platform for essays that have a strong authorial voice and a unique point of view. what will you see on Eidolon? We\u2019re especially interested in submissions between 1,500 and 2,500 words that fall into these categories: Explorations of how the ancient world relates to modern life First-person, anecdotal accounts that bring pieces of classical art or literature to life Personal approaches to academic topics, especially those that embrace marginalized voices Risky, provocative arguments that push the boundaries of accepted consensus views Creative and funny pieces that don\u2019t take the Classics too seriously This list is by no means exhaustive. We expect and hope to be surprised and educated by what people submit.",
