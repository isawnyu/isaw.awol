Greek and Latin in an Age of Open Data -- Conference on Google Hangout December 1-4, 17:00-c. 20:00 CET. At 5pm CET, we will begin broadcasting a conference on Greek and Latin in an Age of Open Data. The conference will run over four days for three hours each because we want to maximize the geographic range while reaching people in reasonable times of the day. (Not everyone is so lucky -- our colleagues Donald Sturgeon and John S. Y. Lee in Hong Kong are, for example, gamely preparing to present in the middle of the night). We will post the final information about connecting on the following link: http://www. dh. uni-leipzig. de/wo/workshop-december-2014/greek-and-latin-in-an-age-of-open-data-schedule/. Our plan is to livestream the presentations and to store them on the new Digital Humanities at Leipzig YouTube channel. This is our first attempt at this and the one thing that I am most sure of is that we will run into all sorts of disasters and mishaps. But as we become accustomed to using this new technology in this (we use it all the time for multiparty video-conferencing among our far-flung collaborators), we are able to engage a wider audience than if we made everyone come to Leipzig.",
