    "description": "Egyptology Resources It's our 20th Anniversary!! Round about mid-August 1994, I set up this site. I still believe it was the first Egyptology site on the net, and certainly it is the only page from that area still going. So I'm celebrating! The site is not as important as it once was, as there are so many other options available, but I'm proud of what it has achieved.",
