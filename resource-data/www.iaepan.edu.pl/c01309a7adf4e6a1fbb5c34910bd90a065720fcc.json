    "description": "Archaeologia Polona: Journal of Archaeology. Archaeologia Polona is a Polish archaeological journal edited and published in the English language annually by the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnology of the Polish Academy of Sciences, intended for an international audience. Its main purpose is to present a wide range of various approaches to the most important problems of contemporary archaeology. It was established in 1958 with intention to popularize Polish archaeology abroad by publishing translations of the most important papers which previously were published in Polish in journals edited by the Institute, mostly in \"Archeologia Polski\". Until 1990 the journal was published by the Ossolineum Publishing House.",
