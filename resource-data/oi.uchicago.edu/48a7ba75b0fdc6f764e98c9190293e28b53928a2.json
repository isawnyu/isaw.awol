    "description": "The Acquisitions List of the Research Archives [Oriental Institute] As one of the elite libraries for the study of the ancient Near East, the Research Archives of the Oriental Institute seeks to comprehensively cover the languages and civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, Syria-Palestine, Anatolia, Iran, the Arabian Peninsula and related areas from the earliest periods to the Hellenistic period through the acquisition of volumes both new and old. The acquisitions list of the Research Archives was formally published from 1991 to 1994. From February 2000 until February 2002, this list was distributed via email and archived online ( http://oi.uchicago.edu/OI/DEPT/RA/RABooks.html ). In recent years, the acquisitions list has only been distributed informally to Oriental Institute faculty, staff and students. Because our acquisitions lists are used by librarians and scholars worldwide as a means by which to supplement their acquisitioning efforts, we have decided to once again make the acquisitions lists of the Research Archives publicly available online in pdf format. We hope that this activity will be permanent and ongoing.",
