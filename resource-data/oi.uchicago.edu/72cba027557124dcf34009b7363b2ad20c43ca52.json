Our Work: Modern Jobs \u2013 Ancient Origins [Paperback*] Photographs by Jason Reblando, interviews by Matthew Cunningham, edited by Jack Green and Emily Teeter Terms of Use Oriental Institute Museum Publications (OIMP) 36 Our Work: Modern Jobs \u2013 Ancient Origins is the catalog for a photo-based exhibit that reveals that many modern professions originated in the ancient Middle East. Artifacts from the Oriental Institute Museum were paired with a baker, farmer, manicurist, brewer, poet, boat builder, judge and other professionals to show the antiquity of these jobs. The portraits are accompanied by commentary on the contributions of the ancient Middle East to life today and new insights into how members of the public view their relationship to the past. This volume will be of interest to educators, historians, and those interested in fine-arts photography.",
