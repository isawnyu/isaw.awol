    "description": "[Originally posted 1/14/10/. Updated 27 June 2013] Late Old Babylonian Personal Names Index By Seth Richardson Welcome to the Late Old Babylonian Personal Names Index. This searchable file of personal names derives from cuneiform texts chiefly dating to the reigns of the last three kings of the First Dynasty of Babylon, 1683-1595 B.C. Version 3 indexes 14,315 unique attestations of personal names from almost 3,000 texts, including 4,678 entries from around 700 unpublished texts. All communications and questions about the Index should be referred to Seth Richardson at: I would like to thank Tate Paulette, Monica Crews, Anna Steinhelper, and Amanda Wissler for their assistance in the preparation of the Index.",
