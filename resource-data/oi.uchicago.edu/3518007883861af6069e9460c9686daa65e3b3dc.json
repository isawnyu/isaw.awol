    "description": "Announced today: SAOC 65. Perspectives on Ptolemaic ThebesOccasional Proceedings of the Theban Workshop. Peter F. Dorman and Betsy M. Bryan, eds. Purchase Book Download PDF Terms of Use The manuscript consists of seven papers presented at the Theban Workshop, 2006. Within the temporal and spatial boundaries indicated by the title, the subjects of the papers are extremely diverse, ranging from models of culture-history (Manning and Moyer), to studies of specific administrative offices (Arlt), a single statue type (Albersmeier), inscriptions in a single temple (DiCerbo/Jasnow, and McClain), and inscriptions of a single king (Ritner). Nonetheless, all the papers are significant contributions to scholarship, presenting new interpretations and conclusions. Two papers (DiCerbo/Jasnow and McClain) are useful preliminary reports on long-term projects. The cross-references in Arlt and Albersmeier\u2019s and in Manning\u2019s and Moyer\u2019s papers attest to value added by presentation at the workshop.
