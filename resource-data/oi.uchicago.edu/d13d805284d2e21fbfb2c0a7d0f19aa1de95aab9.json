    "description": "http://oi.uchicago.edu/OI/DEPT/RA/RABooks.html ). In recent years, the acquisitions list has only been distributed informally to Oriental Institute faculty, staff and students. Because our acquisitions lists are used by librarians and scholars worldwide as a means by which to supplement their acquisitioning efforts, we have decided to once again make the acquisitions lists of the Research Archives publicly available online in pdf format. We hope that this activity will be permanent and ongoing.
