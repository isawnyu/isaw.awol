Eli and Daniel al-Qumisi in their exegetical approaches to biblical prophecy); history of modern scholarship (Maria Angeles Gallego presents an overview of the stages of modern European research -- beginning in the 18th century -- on medieval Judaeo-Arabic, with specific emphasis on Iberian Spanish scholarship), Jewish socio-cultural history (Moshe Gil provides a glimpse into the state of food commerce in the Geniza community from the evidence of merchants\u2019 letters; Joshua Holo considers the evidence for Gershom b. Judah\u2019s Italian extraction and its relevance for understanding the origin of Ashkenazic Jewish culture; Benjamin Z.

Lasker surveys and assesses the history of a specific textual variation in Judah ha-Levi\u2019s Book of the Kuzari); codicological-textual history (Paul Saenger analyzes the relationship between chapter divisions of the Pentateuch in Christian -- especially Latin -- Bibles and those in Jewish tradition); Dead Sea Scrolls (Anthony J. Tomasino critically evaluates the formation and supporting data for the current consensus regarding the messianic nature of 4Q246; Michael O. Wise analyzes the content and dating of the manuscripts from Murabba\u2019at and considers their contribution to our knowledge of various personalities who lived during the First and Second Jewish Revolts); and historiography (Isaac Kalimi assesses the historiographical method of the writer of the book of Chronicles in light of both inner-canonical and extra-biblical considerations). Also included is a comprehensive bibliography of the honoree\u2019s works as well as discrete indexes of manuscripts, biblical references, classical and medieval works, and general items.
