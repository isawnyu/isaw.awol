    "description": "[First posted in AWOL 9 November 2009. Updated 8 February 2013] SBL Seminar Papers In years past, a print edition of the SBL Seminar Papers was made available in advance of the Annual Meeting each year in order to stimulate discussion of these works in progress during the meeting itself. Beginning in 2004, however, the print edition was discontinued, with a selection of papers presented at the meeting being made available online. In addition, a number of papers from previous years have been archived on the SBL Web site. Because these papers represent works in progress, they should not be quoted or otherwise cited without permission from the author.
