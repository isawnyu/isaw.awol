    "description": "Diogenes. ISSN: 2054-6696. Launched in January 2014, Diogenes (ISSN 2054-6696) is a open-access online journal edited by the postgraduate students at the Centre for Byzantine, Ottoman and Modern Greek Studies, University of Birmingham. This collaboration of postgraduate students aims at providing a venue at which postgraduate students can further develop their research ideas and communicate them to a general audience. The unique combination of research interests at the Centre brings together the often separate fields of Byzantine, Ottoman and Modern Greek Studies. We look forward to any article that actively engages with any of these fields, from universities in the UK and abroad. It is published twice a year: in January and October.
