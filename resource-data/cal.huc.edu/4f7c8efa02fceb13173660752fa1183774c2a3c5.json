    "description": "Welcome to the first complete online academic lexicon of a classical Semitic language and the first dictionary of all of the classical dialects of Aramaic.\u00a0 As an online dictionary, the CAL itself has many advantages over the traditional printed book: Entries may be accessed by root, by canonical form, or by the complete form as found in texts.\u00a0 For example, confronted by \u05d5\u05d1\u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05d5\u05ea\u05d4 the entry can be found by searching for the form as it is, by the root \u201cmlk\u201d or by the lemma \u201cmlkw.\u201d No longer is alphabetization an issue. Entries may be accessed by the Aramaic word, by any English word used in the glosses, or by certain semantic fields. Citations within entries may be searched. Searching may use Roman transliteration, Unicode, Square script (Hebrew) or Syriac keyboards. Citations from the database are linked to the full text.\u00a0 Click on a citation in an entry to see it in its original context.\u00a0 From the context, you will find yourself in text browse mode where a click on any other word displays the appropriate lexical entry. A complicated entry may also be viewed without justifying citations so as to better study its overall semantic structure. Entries display the page numbers where a word is treated in the major previous dialect dictionaries and, more importantly, links to online displays of those digitized pages where allowed by copyright. There are no separate pages for abbreviations.\u00a0 Hover with the mouse over an unfamiliar abbreviation and a revealing \u201ctooltip\u201d appears. The CAL is live!\u00a0 We are constantly adding texts, adding new words, and improving entries.\u00a0 Active work is in progress improving our textbases and treatments of the less well-known dialects, in particular Mandaic, Samaritan, and Nabataean. All scholarly references to the CAL should thus include the date when the reference was found.\u00a0 We invite corrections from users! Although in the sense of the previous paragraph the CAL is not yet \u201ccomplete,\u201d we have decided to open the lexicon to academe: As of February, 2013, our database consists of over two million parsed words, over 30,000 individual lemmas (and 7,000 cross-references), over 60,000 glosses, and about 20,000 citations.",
