    "description": "SAFE: Saving Antiquities for Everyone. <blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"> SAFE is pleased to announce the relaunch of our web site (still http://savingantiquities. org) and blog, now fully integrated as part of the site. All the posts (and corresponding comments) have transferred to this new site at <a href=\"http://www. savingantiquities. org/blog/\" title=\"BLOG\">http://savingantiquities. org/blog/</a>. Our web site has a new look, but the more important goal with this relaunch is to provide an easier user experience by bringing nearly 200 pages of content more upfront and visible. To present an easier platform for your participation many of the new pages have an area for comments. Frequent visitors to the previous site (that we launched in <a href=\"http://www. savingantiquities. org/wp-content/pdf/SAFEPR1. pdf\">July 2003</a>) will notice a reorganization of the material, addition of graphics, interactive tools, and easier access to our ever-growing social media presence. Blog posts are now put into categories. Take a tour of our new <a href=\"http://www. savingantiquities. org/resources-3/\">resources section</a> where items can now be searched by topic, region and date. The news section on the home page has up-to-the-minute reports, and polls are now on their own <a href=\"http://www. savingantiquities. org/the-home-page/polls/\">separate page</a>. These are a few of the new features; please peruse the site to make your own discoveries. Every piece of content has been reconsidered and displayed in a new way with these goals in mind; but if we missed anything please let us know. We think that our new site is an improvement, but it is <em>your</em> opinion. <a class=\"morelink\" href=\"http://www. savingantiquities. org/welcome-to-safes-new-home/\">(More. )</a></blockquote> http://savingantiquities. org/blog/ <blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"> SAFE is pleased to announce the relaunch of our web site (still http://savingantiquities. org) and blog, now fully integrated as part of the site.
