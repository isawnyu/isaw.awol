    "description": "[First posted in AWOL. 9 November 2009. Updated 8 September 2014]. Hirundo, the McGill Journal of Classical Studies, is published once a year by the Classics Students Association of McGill. The journal is completely authored, edited, and produced by undergraduate students at McGill University. Hirundo seeks contributions from students and alumni related to the ancient Mediterranean world broadly defined. Essays on Classical art and literature, ancient European and Near Eastern history from the prehistoric through late antique periods, religious studies, ancient philosophy, and the Classical tradition are welcome. Hirundo aims to bring together students with diverse yet overlapping interests, and offer them the opportunity to publish their work for a wider audience and thereby promote Classical Studies. Volume I (2001) Volume II (2002) Volume III (2004) Volume IV (2005-06) Volume V (2006-07) Volume VI (2007-08) Volume VII (2008-09) Volume VIII (2009-10) Volume IX (2010-11) Volume X (2011-12) Volume XI (2012-13) Volume XII (2013-14).",
