    "description": "Imaging the Iliad: A Digital Renaissance The Iliad, Homer\u2019s epic poem about Achilles and The Trojan War, is the center of this story about an international team of Classicists and Scientists who work together using state-of-the-art technologies to reveal the mysteries of the Venetus A, the oldest existing complete text of the Homeric Iliad. Meticulously crafted in Byzantium the Venetus A has been stored for 500 years in the Marciana Library in Venice, Italy. Its thousand-year-old pages contain handwritten notes recording a tradition of scholarship going back to the Ptolemaic scholars of the second century BCE. Two thousand years after the start of that tradition, technology brings scholars and lovers of Homer a new opportunity to rediscover the intricacies of this precious manuscript. The interdisciplinary research team struggles to reconcile old and new and overcome technical challenges as they press toward the goal of preserving for all time one of the most valuable artifacts of the Byzantine Empire.",
