    "description": "structure of the corpus DCS is designed for research in Sanskrit linguistics and philology. Users can search for lexical units and their collocations in a corpus of about 3. 250. 000 manually tagged words in 430. 000 sentences. In addition, DCS generates distributional key values and performs statistical tests that can be used to assess the distribution of lexical units from a chronological perspective. The digital corpus offers two points of entry for the philological research: Lexical units can be retrieved from the dictionary via a query interface or a dictionary page. For each lexical unit contained in the corpus, DCS offers the complete set of references and a statistical evaluation based on historical principles. More about the query interface, the dictionary and the detail evaluation of lexical units As an alternative, philological research can start from the interlinear lexical analysis that accompanies each text contained in the database. Information about the text interface.",
