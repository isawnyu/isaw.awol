    "description": "Asfar is a new dynamic initiative designed to inspire, provide a platform and offer a support network to young people, students and graduates specialising in and interested by the Middle East. Through a quarterly e-journal, News updates, and a Travelers Network, Asfar will work with the next generation of the Middle East's writers, thinkers and photographers to exhibit their abilities to a wide audience including academia, diplomatic and general readership. Focusing on the history, society, culture, development and politics of the Middle East, the e-journal will introduce new ideas, innovative articles and magnificent images of the Middle East. Remaining politically neutral and non-partisan, Asfar articles will cover a full range of topics: from geography to art, languages to society and from history to cookery. Asfar will review the past and consider the Middle East's future from a regional, state and local perspective. Asfar is unique project aimed at promoting the study of the region, the curiosity and personal development of individuals fascinated by the Middle East and ensuring the sustained awareness of an area on the cross roads of history.",
