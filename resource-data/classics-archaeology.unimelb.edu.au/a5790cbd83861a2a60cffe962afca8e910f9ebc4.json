    "description": "[First posted in AWOL 30 August 2011. Updated 29 August 2013] Iris: Journal of the Classical Association of Victoria ISSN 1448-1421 What is Iris ? Iris is the journal of the Classical Association of Victoria. The New Series of the journal was founded in 1988. The Journal Editor is Dr Rhiannon Evans of La Trobe University. The Honorary Secretary is Dr. K.O. Chong-Gossard, lecturer at the University of Melbourne. Iris is published with the support of the Muriel P. Blackwood Memorial Fund. What is in Iris? The most recent issue - Volume 24, 2011 - is now available for download. Iris is now a refereed publication. This means that articles published in the refereed section undergo a peer review process. This involves assessment of the publication in its entirety (not merely an abstract or extract), before publication, and by appropriately independent, qualified experts. Independent in this context means independent of the author. How do I contribute to Iris ? Persons interested into submitting articles or letters to the journal should send them to either the Journal Editor ( Rhiannon Evans ) or the Honorary Secretary (K.O. Chong-Gossard). Contributors should state whether they wish their article to be refereed or not.
