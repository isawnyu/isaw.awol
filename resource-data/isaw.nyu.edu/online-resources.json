ISAW Papers is an open-content scholarly journal that publishes article-length works on any topic within the scope of ISAW's scholarly research. All works are distributed under a Creative Commons-Attribution license and will be archived in the NYU Faculty Digital Archive (FDA). ISAW is collaborating with the NYU Library's Digital Library Technology Services team to deliver innovative digital versions through a richly-linked online reader in harmony with another joint initiative, the AncientWorldDigitalLibrary (AWDL), which aims to accelerate and enhance access to the emerging global library of digital publications on the ancient world. Articles in ISAW Papers are either anonymously reviewed by expert readers or are submitted by individual faculty members. The review process for each document is clearly indicated. As part of ISAW's digital publication initiative, the editorial workflow of ISAW Papers will come to rely on authoring tools that enable lower-cost creation of high-quality digital resources.",
