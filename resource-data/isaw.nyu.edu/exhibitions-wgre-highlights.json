    "description": "When the Greeks Ruled Egypt: From Alexander the Great to Cleopatra. October 8, 2014 - January 4, 2015. When the Greeks Ruled Egypt: From Alexander the Great to Cleopatra examines the interactions between Greek and Egyptian cultures during the nearly 300-year period when Egypt was under Greek rule. With some 150 objects, the exhibition reveals the many and diverse ways in which cultural tropes were strategically used by Egypt\u2019s Ptolemaic rulers as a means of asserting power and provoking loyalty among the conquered population. In the process, it also reveals the intense familial intrigue that characterized the Ptolemies as they sought to maintain their position.",
