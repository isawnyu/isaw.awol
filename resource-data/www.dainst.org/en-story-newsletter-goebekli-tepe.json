    "description": "G\u00f6bekli Tepe Newsletter. This year marks the 20th anniversary of archaeological research at G\u00f6bekli Tepe. Looking back over the past two decades, it is safe to say that G\u00f6bekli Tepe has not only provided us with new and unexpected insights, forcing us to reconsider many previous assumptions with respect to the early Neolithic period (the transition from mobile hunter-gatherers to sedentary food-producing lifeways), further the site has seen itself catapulted by the world media into the consciousness of many, fuelling the imagination and giving rise to some very diverse lines of serious (and less serious) enquiry and speculation. Over the years, G\u00f6bekli Tepe has moved increasingly into the centre of public interest. Meanwhile, in addition to a series of popular science films and publications, there is a large and steadily growing number of people who wish to experience this unique site at first hand; remarkably, on busy days our excavations attract up to 1. 000 visitors. This has opened up a challenging new field of activity for the project team: the mediation of our knowledge to the interested public. This is achieved, for example, through regular publications and lectures, as well as by frequent photo exhibitions and visits to local schools in Urfa. And now through our new newsletter! Learn more about the scientific work, exhibition projects, forthcoming events or new publications and download the first issue here: Newsletter G\u00f6bekli Tepe first issue (PDF 3,8MB).
