From 1979 to the present, the Yale University Tell Leilan Project has been excavating at Tell Leilan, Syria ( ) and conducting systematic archaeological surface surveys in the Tell Leilan region. Tell Leilan is one of the largest archaeological sites in Syria and was one of the most important cities in Northern Mesopotamia during the second and third millennia BC, when it was known as \u0160ehna and \u0160ubat-Enlil. Today, the ancient city walls still rise five to fifteen meters above plains of northeastern Syria, enclosing an area of 90 hectares, nearly a square kilometer. The 15 hectare \"Acropolis\", the oldest and highest part of the site, founded about 5,000 BC, dominates the surrounding 65 hectare \"Lower Town,\" which like the city wall dates to the urbanization of this settlement at ca. 2600 BC.",
