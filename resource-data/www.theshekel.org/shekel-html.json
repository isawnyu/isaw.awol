Since 1967, \"The Shekel\" has been an award winning entertaining and informing bi-monthly magazine - that has been called \"The Jewish Readers Digest. \"But you don't have to be Jewish to enjoy this fully illustrated information-packed magazine. For instance articles have included Bible Quotations on Mormon Coins, Shroud of Turin Coin Theory Disputed, the Widow's Mite, and so on. Plus articles about Anne Frank, Albert Einstein, Raoul Wallenberg, Hank Greenberg, etc. Members can read original articles and selected material from around the world in each 48-page issue of \"The Shekel\" - at a cost of less than 10 cents per day.",
