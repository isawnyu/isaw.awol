    "description": "JURN is a search-engine indexing free \u2018open access\u2019 ejournals in the arts and humanities, along with other arts and scholarly journals offering free content.How do I use it? You can use it just like Google. JURN is running on a Google Custom Search; so JURN is speedy, and you can use all the usual Google search modifers, such as intitle:\u201dyour phrase\u201d and filetype:pdf But I assume the typical user will have an adequate grasp of the best ways to search Google, and will thus also have some idea of the exact terms they need to use. For example, a unsophisticated search for\u2026 Gender Studies Shakespeare\u2026will only obtain an interesting but very broad overview, while a search such as such as\u2026 intitle:\u201dThe Tempest\u201d gender\u2026 will return much more specific results.",
