    "description": "The Palestine Exploration Fund flickr Photostream The PEF was founded in 1865 and is the oldest organization in the world created specifically for the study of the Levant, the southern portion of which was conventionally known as \u2018Palestine\u2019. The PEF is a major bridge and information resource for the public and academic community. It publishes an internationally respected journal, the Palestine Exploration Quarterly, and brings the latest archaeological results and research to the public in a series of regular lectures. The PEF promotes ongoing research through annual grants to scholars across the world. The PEF archives hold over 40,000 photographs of Palestine, Jordan and Syria taken from 1850 onwards. The PEF collections also include archaeological artefacts, natural history specimens, maps, manuscripts, and paintings. Our unparalleled library attracts scholars from around the world. These facilities are available to our members for research, study, and publication purposes. The photos shown here are low resolution files from our digital picture library, with a particular focus on our collection of 19th century photographs. If you would like to reproduce any of these at high resolution, please contact our curator for reproduction fees which help fund our charitable work. You are free to use any of the low-res images and metadata presented here online or for teaching and research, but please let us know if you intend to do so by contacting: execsec@pef.org.uk. Please include in your caption: \"Courtesy of the Palestine Exploration Fund\". You can join us for an annual subscription of \u00a336 (\u00a318 for students) or \u00a354 for a joint membership, which gives you access to the library and collection, lectures and 3 journals published annually. A number of PEF and PEF related publications feature the photographic collection. Visit the PEF website for more information. Acknowledgments: the PEF wishes to thank the following people contributed to the digitisation and gathering of information on these images over the years: Rupert Chapman, Felicity Cobbing, Lydia Collins, Shimon Gibson and Pamela Magrill.
