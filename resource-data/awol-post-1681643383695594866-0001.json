    "description": "The Syriac Studies Reference Library is a collection of rare and out-of-print titles that are of vital importance for Syriac studies. It is especially rich in early manuscript catalogs, dictionaries, and grammars, and contains many of the indispensable editions of Syriac texts that were produced in the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries. This collection was scanned from the holdings of the Semitics/ICOR Library of The Catholic University of America. More about the project\u2026",
