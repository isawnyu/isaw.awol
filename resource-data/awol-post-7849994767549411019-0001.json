    "description": "The editors of Hugoye: Journal of Syriac Studies are pleased to announce a new publication policy: instead of waiting until January (Issue 1) or July (Issue 2) to release new articles on our webiste, we will add them to a new Preview Draft page as soon as they are ready for publication. The primary benefit of this new model is that it reduces the amount of time between submission and publication. The Preview Draft page is now up and running, and the first article for Hugoye 16.2 has already been posted. We hope that both our readers and our authors will find this new policty helpful.",
