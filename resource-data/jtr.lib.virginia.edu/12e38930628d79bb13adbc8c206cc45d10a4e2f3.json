The Journal of Textual Reasoning\u00a0is the main publishing expression of the Society of Textual Reasoning, which sponsors an electronic list-serve [textualreasoning@list. mail. virginia. edu] and meetings at professional academic conferences. The Journal will publish essays in the exegetical analyses of Jewish texts and the practice of textual reasoning as well as statements in the on-going development of the theory of Textual Reasoning. The Journal will generally follow a particular theme in each issue and include reviews of books relevant to Textual Reasoning. In the traditions of rabbinic thought and dialogical philosophy, we aim to present individual articles along with commentaries to them.
