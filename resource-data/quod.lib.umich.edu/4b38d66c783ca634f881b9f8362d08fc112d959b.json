    "description": "Journal of the Association for History and Computing. <blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">This journal is sponsored by the American Association for History and Computing (AAHC), organized at a conference held in Cincinnati in January 1996. The AAHC aspires to promote and develop interest in the use of computers in all types of historical study at every level, in both teaching and research. We believe that computers and computing are rapidly changing important elements of the work of historians and students of history, constituting a major transformation in the way knowledge is created and communicated. A major goal of this journal is to help define useful standards to maximize the utility of computers in historical studies. <br/><br/>We welcome contributions from those interested in issues or resources related to history and computing. This journal contains peer-reviewed articles intended as a contribution to this field, and some peer-reviewed works-in-progress intended to solicit thoughtful criticism. <br/>. <ul><li><a href=\"http://quod. lib. umich. edu/j/jahc/browse. html\" title=\"browse all issues\">Browse all issues</a></li><li><a href=\"http://quod. lib. umich. edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=jahc;page=browse;key=author\" title=\"browse by author\">Browse by author</a></li><li><a href=\"http://quod. lib. umich. edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=jahc;page=browse\" title=\"browse by article title\">Browse by title</a></li></ul></blockquote> Browse all issues Browse by author Browse by title.",
