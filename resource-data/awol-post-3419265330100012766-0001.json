    "description": "The Nemea Center for Classical Archaeology, a research unit within the Department of Classics, founded in 2004, promotes teaching, research, and public service centered on the University of California excavations at Nemea, Greece and its surrounding region. The Center fosters an environment of teaching and scholarly cooperation that is a model in the field of classical archaeology.\u00a0 The Center is composed of the Nemea Excavation Archives, housed in 7125 Dwinelle Hall, University of California, Berkeley, and the Nemea Archaeological Center in Nemea, Greece, which is composed of the Bowker House complex (residences, common room/kitchen, storage areas and garden), the Thomas J. Long Study Room in the Nemea Archaeological Museum (office/drafting space, research library and archive of original excavation materials) and the Nemean land to which Berkeley holds scientific rights. All the work and activities of the Nemea Center, including staff support, is financed solely through donations. If you are interested in making a donation please visit our \u201cDonate\u201d website for information.\u00a0The Nemea Center maintains an occasional electronic publication designed to keep friends and supporters of Nemea connected to what is happening at the Center both in Berkeley and in Greece.Most recent LionBytes: Fall 2012LionBytes Back Issues",
