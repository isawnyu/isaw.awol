    "description": "Analytical Approaches to World Music (AAWM). The online journal Analytical Approaches to World Music (AAWM) aims to bring together analysts from a broad range of conceptual and cultural traditions in order to explore new modes of musical description and understanding capable of navigating the multicultural soundscape of the twenty-first century. In so doing, AAWM seeks to expand the potential for musical analysis from a cross-cultural perspective by applying diverse theoretical and analytical concepts to repertoires outside the Western art music tradition. We welcome submissions that examine world musical traditions from a wide variety of analytical and theoretical perspectives. These may include, but are not limited to: the adaptation of analytical approaches usually associated with Western art music to address various world music traditions; the use of indigenous analytical tools and strategies to characterize particular musical styles and genres; and the development of \"hybrid\" analytical systems and theories that integrate the aforementioned approaches. Furthermore, we whole-heartedly embrace research that encompasses various formal, cultural, aesthetic and philosophical analytical perspectives. It is our hope that by bringing together analysts from a broad range of conceptual and cultural traditions, new modes of musical description and understanding may emerge. Please visit the journal website to view the complete submission guidelines, as well as the current issue and online discussion forum.",
