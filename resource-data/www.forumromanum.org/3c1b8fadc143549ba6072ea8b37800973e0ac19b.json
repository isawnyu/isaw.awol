    "description": "[First posted 8 December 2009, updated 30 November 2013]. Corpus Scriptorum Latinorum (CSL). The Corpus Scriptorum Latinorum (CSL) is a collaborative project among scholars from a variety of disciplines with the main purpose of creating a digital library of Latin literature, spanning from the earliest epigraphic remains to the Neo-Latinists of the eighteenth century. Toward this end, we maintain an up-to-date catalogue of all Latin texts that are currently available online, making CSL a single, centralized resource for locating Latin literature on the internet. In addition to serving as a gateway to texts on other sites, we are also actively working to expand the online corpus, providing hundreds of original Latin texts and translations. To ensure the overall quality of these resources, all submissions to the CSL are submitted to thorough proofing, but we ask our visitors to double-check our listings and alert us to any of the errors or omissions that inevitably remain. If you would like to help contribute to our project, please visit our submissions page for more information.",
