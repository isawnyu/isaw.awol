    "description": "The Brown Classical Journal was founded in 1984 by Professor Alison Goddard Elliott, who nurtured the editors and contributors of that first volume as Faculty Editor. Sadly, the volume was dedicated to her memory. Susan Hueck Allen, then a graduate student, designed the logo for the journal, which was used for the first eleven volumes. The BCJ is published annually and typically is printed in the spring.\u00a0 The purpose of the BCJ, as explained in the editorial statement of Volume 1, is \"to encourage and to reward well written essays by students of the Classics at Brown University.\"",
