    "description": "PAREKBOLAI is an electronic journal, which is published yearly by an Editorial Committee of Byzantinists of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. The name is inseparably linked with the well-known Commentaries of Eustathius of Thessalonica, and was chosen as a sign of both the journal\u2019s association with the University of Thessaloniki as host institution and its subject matter. The journal publishes original articles on Byzantine Literature and Philology as well as related text-based studies covering the period from the 4th to the 15th centuries in English, French, German, Greek, and Italian. All articles submitted will be peer-reviewed by two members of the journal\u2019s International Editorial Advisory Board, and once approved will be uploaded immediately as pdf files, which will be created by the Editors in consultation with the authors.",
