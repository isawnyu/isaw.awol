    "description": "Ancient History Encyclopedia Our Vision Ancient History Encyclopedia is a source of ancient history information, provided by a community of historians and history enthusiasts. The goal is to make quality ancient history information freely available on the internet, which is something that is clearly missing: Books are expensive, Wikipedia is comprehensive but unreliable, and\u00a0 many other sites are either amateurish, with a nationalist agenda, or their presentation is so bad that it nearly makes them useless. Peer Review In order to make Ancient History Encyclopedia a free source of quality information, all content on this website is reviewed for quality before it is published. We aim to peer review as much content as possible to ensure quality. Our team consists of volunteers who are qualified in the field of ancient history, such as teachers, historians, archaeologists, or writers. If you wish to help, please contact us. Non-Profit Ancient History Encyclopedia is a non-profit website. There is no company behind the site, and we do not aim to make money. As you have noticed, we don't have any ads on the site: This is because we believe that a good presentation is key in conveying information - advertisements only distract from what's important. Having said that, there are currently two ways in which we make some money: All the books on this site come from Amazon, and when you buy a book through our site, we get a small commission. Also, in the Google search there are some ads, for which we also get money when you click them. All money that we earn is used to pay for the servers, and for upgrading to better servers. We want to give you a great user experience without endless waiting for your information.",
