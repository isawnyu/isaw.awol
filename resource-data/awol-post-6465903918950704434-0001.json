    "description": "The ultimate outcomes of Latin studies relate to your quality of consciousness, and to the breadth and depth of your vision. You do not even know who you are if you have no memory. If you develop your memory of and appreciation of significant realities, if you learn how to judge what is helpful and admirable and what is not, then you are being helped to becoming a greater person yourself, that unique \"greater person\" that you are called to be. (\"Become who you are!\" says Pindar.) Latinity is a significant part of the past for us. We have to know it to more fully know who we are culturally, but it also gives us a wealth of material that can help us to fashion ourselves individually.Latest Developments\u00a0 Map and Contents\u00a0 LatinPraxis\u00a0 Grammar / Vocabulary Helps\u00a0 Verbal Brilliance in Latin\u00a0 Elementary Readers\u00a0 Rudimenta in Motu (Flash movies)\u00a0 GRASP Method\u00a0 Acceleration Readers\u00a0 Timelines for Roman History\u00a0 Kindle Latin\u00a0 Reading Acceleration Machine\u00a0 Paedagogica\u00a0 Advice for Learning Vocabulary\u00a0 Related\u00a0Sites\u00a0 \u00a0WHY Latin?\u00a0 \u00a0SLU Classical Program InformationContact Information",
