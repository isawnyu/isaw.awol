    "description": "Archaeogaming: Exploring the archaeology of (and in) video games. Archaeogaming is a blog dedicated to the discussion of the archaeology both of and in video games (console, computer, mobile, etc. ). If a game uses archaeology in some way (like the Archaeology skill in World of Warcraft ), we\u2019ll discuss it here. If the design and function of pottery, textiles, and architecture vary between iterations of a game (e. g. , Elder Scrolls ), we\u2019ll discuss it here. If a game contains an archaeologist character class or NPC (non-player character), we\u2019ll discuss it here. We\u2019ll review games containing (or about) archaeology, too. If you\u2019d like to write a game review or contribute a guest post, please email.",
