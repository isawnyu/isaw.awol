    "description": "Roman Military Equipment Conference (ROMEC) which, since 1983, has met to discuss the arms, armour, and military fittings of the Roman army. The proceedings of these volumes have been published (four of them by British Archaeological Reports) but Arma now provides an opportunity for the publication of short notes on recent finds, news of relevant publications, and a running bibliography of academic articles published on the subject since 1980. The newsletter also supplies details about forthcoming events, including of course the next ROMEC",
