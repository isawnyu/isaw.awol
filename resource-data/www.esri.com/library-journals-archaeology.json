As desktop computers and GIS technology have become more powerful and easier to use, archaeologists are inventing new ways of collecting, analyzing, managing, and communicating their data using GIS. Papers in Volume 1 of the Journal of GIS in Archaeology address these uses of GIS in various archaeological contexts and scales-from the excavation unit to the globe.",
