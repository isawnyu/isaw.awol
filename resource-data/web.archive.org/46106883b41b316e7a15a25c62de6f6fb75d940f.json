    "description": "[First posted in AWOL 17 April 2911. Updated 24 April 2013]. Archaeology in the United Arab EmiratesThe aim of the journal 'Archaeology of the United Arab Emirates' is to promote and enhance interest in the archaeological heritage of the United Arab Emirates. It aims to serve as a publication forum for those interested in the latest survey, excavation and research results from archaeological sites in the UAE. Volumes 1 to 5 of this journal were previously published by the former Department of Antiquities and Tourism, Al Ain, between 1976-1989. Papers presented at this conference will be published in the journal, 'Archaeology in the United Arab Emirates - Volume 6', which will provide up-to-date documentation of the current status of archaeological research in the UAE. Following the conference participants will have until the 15 May 2011 to submit the written version of their paper. This should not exceed a total of 5000 words (including the references), with a maximum of 10 figures or plates. We plan to carry out peer reviewing of all submitted papers which will then be published as Volume 6 of the journal, \"Archaeology of the United Arab Emirates\".
