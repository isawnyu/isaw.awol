    "description": "[First posted in AWOL 25 November 2013, updated 25 December 2014]. British Museum Technical Research Bulletin (BMTRB). The Technical Research Bulletin publishes the results of collaborative work by the British Museum's curators, conservators and scientists covering a broad range of objects and materials from across the Museum\u2019s collection. Published once a year, each issue aims to encompass objects from different continents, historical periods and material types. The Bulletin is designed to appeal both to those with a general interest in the Museum\u2019s collections and those with a specialist interest who wish to broaden their horizons.",
