    "description": "ELECTRUM Magazine: Why the Past Matters <blockquote>We at ELECTRUM Magazine are keen on studying the past or \u2013 perhaps more humbly \u2013 what we think it was. Some of us are archaeologically trained or we are professional historians and art historians and investigative journalists never tiring of asking questions of the past, even if we sometimes receive other answers to unasked questions rather than the ones we ask. <div></div>We at ELECTRUM respect that amateurs or professionals in other fields may love history as much or more than we do. Our readers are people who love history in its many aspects. We at ELECTRUM are old enough to know the past matters, we are young enough to hope we can add a valuable resource for others in electronic format. You wouldn\u2019t hire someone on the spot or marry someone without attempting to discover that person\u2019s past, nor would you buy a used car based on a whim without carefully checking its history and provenance as best you could. This is also true of collecting antiquities, which is usually problematic, or fact-checking history, which can change. So the past matters. It is why we go to museums and attend lectures about archaeology and history in order to expand our personal horizons. We at ELECTRUM are advocates of the Archaeological Institute of America; most of us here are long-standing members and abide by its standards and ethical practices. Rather than being so lost in the past or unhappy with the present or fearful of the future as to bury our heads in the sand, we constantly seek to understand ourselves better by examining whatever we can about our human ancestry. Thus we at ELECTRUM are constantly looking for links \u2013 and assistance from a reading public \u2013 to increase our own and others\u2019 wider understanding of \u00a0\u2019Why the Past Matters. \u2019<div class=\"wrapper\"><ul class=\"dropdown dropdown-horizontal\" id=\"nav\"><li class=\"menu-item menu-item-type-custom menu-item-object-custom current-menu-item current_page_item menu-item-home menu-item-100\" id=\"menu-item-100\"><a href=\"http://www. electrummagazine. com/\">Home</a></li><li class=\"menu-item menu-item-type-taxonomy menu-item-object-category menu-item-14\" id=\"menu-item-14\"><a href=\"http://www. electrummagazine. com/category/short_takes/\">Short Takes</a></li><li class=\"menu-item menu-item-type-taxonomy menu-item-object-category menu-item-8\" id=\"menu-item-8\"><a href=\"http://www. electrummagazine. com/category/archaeologia/\">Archaeology</a></li><li class=\"menu-item menu-item-type-taxonomy menu-item-object-category menu-item-21\" id=\"menu-item-21\"><a href=\"http://www. electrummagazine. com/category/controversies/\">Controversies</a></li><li class=\"menu-item menu-item-type-taxonomy menu-item-object-category menu-item-12\" id=\"menu-item-12\"><a href=\"http://www. electrummagazine. com/category/photo_essays/\">Photo Essays</a></li><li class=\"menu-item menu-item-type-taxonomy menu-item-object-category menu-item-11\" id=\"menu-item-11\"><a href=\"http://www. electrummagazine. com/category/history_underfoot/\">History Underfoot</a></li><li class=\"menu-item menu-item-type-taxonomy menu-item-object-category menu-item-9\" id=\"menu-item-9\"><a href=\"http://www. electrummagazine. com/category/classics/\">Classics</a></li><li class=\"menu-item menu-item-type-taxonomy menu-item-object-category menu-item-13\" id=\"menu-item-13\"><a href=\"http://www. electrummagazine. com/category/reviews/\">Reviews</a></li></ul></div></blockquote> Home Short Takes Archaeology Controversies Photo Essays History Underfoot Classics Reviews.",
