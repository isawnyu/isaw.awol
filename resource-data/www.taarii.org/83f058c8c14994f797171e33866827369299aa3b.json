    "description": "[First posted in AWOL 10/25/09.\u00a0 Updated 19 December 2013] TAARII Newsletter: The American Academic Research Institute in Iraq The American Academic Research Institute in Iraq (TAARII \u2014 formerly the American Association for Research in Baghdad, AARB) has been established to promote scholarly research on and in Iraq and ancient Mesopotamia. The Institute, a consortium of American universities and museums, intends to establish a multidisciplinary American scholarly research center in Iraq when conditions permit. TAARII raises funds for graduate and post-graduate fellowships for Americans to work on Iraq in as broad a range of disciplines as possible. It also has a fellowship program for Iraqi academics to aid them in carrying out research in Iraq. TAARII initiates its own research projects and fosters joint projects between American and Iraqi academics. Like similar American overseas research centers, TAARII has as its primary focus the humanities and social sciences, as well as closely related natural sciences, but it will facilitate outstanding research in any legitimate academic field. ANNOUNCEMENT As readers may by aware, TAARII is committed to producing and printing a bilingual newsletter in English and in Arabic. Our September 2007 issue, sadly, was printed primarily in English (with Arabic to appear on the website). We regret that, beginning with the Spring 2008 issue, our newsletter is in printed in English only. We hope to seek funds for its Arabic translation for posting on our website and are actively seeking support for the ongoing cost of translation, so that we can continue printing a bilingual edition. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we raise the necessary funds.",
