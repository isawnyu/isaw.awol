    "description": "The Armenian History by Agathangelos written in the mid\u20105th century and nar\u2010rating about the conversion of Armenia to Christianity in the early fourth century was soon translated into Greek and other languages: Arabic, Old Russian, and Georgian. There also exist shorter re\u00accen\u00acsions (known as The Life of St. Gregory) in Karshuni, Ethio\u2010pian, Coptic, Greek, Georgian, Latin, and Arabic. The Greek version of the History is extant in nine manuscripts dating from the 8th\u201012th cc. Only one of them, kept in the Laurentian library of Florence, Plut. VII, cod. Gr. 25 (12th c. ), contains nine initial para\u2010graphs absent from the Armenian original and from the other recensions. READ MORE.",
