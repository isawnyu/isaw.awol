    "description": "Sar\u2010Gand\u0101b is located in the western part of Iran, in the Zagros Mountains, close to the border between the provinces of Ilam and Lorestan (Fig1). The geographical coordinates of the sites are 33\u00b030'21. 17\"N, 46\u00b053'44. 29\"E. Sar\u2010Gand\u0101b is 36 km northeast of Seymareh Dam, as the crew flies (Fig2). It is possible that the strategic significance of the site in antiquity was more than what present conditions suggest: Sar\u2010Gand\u0101b is located on a natural northwest\u2010southeast passage through a narrow valley of Zagros. At some locations, valley is as narrow as three kilometers. But, at the vicinity of Sar\u2010Gand\u0101b, the valley widens and reaches a maximum width of four kilometers (Fig3). Water is abundant. In addition to the River Seymareh, a Sulphur spring originates near the site and its water is used for irrigated agriculture (Fig6). READ MORE.",
