    "description": "The proper term for law is the Middle Persian d\u0101d although the meaning of d\u0101d is more complex than the Western concept of law. In fact, several texts attest to the dual meaning of d\u0101d as both law and religion, sometimes understood as a religious law, sometimes as a synonym of religion, sometimes as a secular law or the king\u2019s command. It is only the context of the text which is helpful to decide which meaning was referred to. In the Pahlawi Riw\u0101yat Accompanying the D\u0101dest\u0101n \u012b D\u0113n\u012bg d\u0101d has the dual meaning of religion and law: \u2019when someone goes over from the (religious) law to which he belongs to another law he is margarz\u0101n, because he is deserting the Good Religion, and he is taking up this bad law\u2019.
