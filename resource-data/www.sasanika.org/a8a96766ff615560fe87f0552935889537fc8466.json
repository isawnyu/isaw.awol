    "description": "The highland district of \u0100bd\u0101n\u0101n is located in the southern portion of Ilam province. It is dominated by the mountain of Kabir\u2010Kuh which stands over it like a massive wall. In 2001, a team from the Archaeological Department of Bu\u2010Ali Sina University conducted a regional survey of this area. In total, 51 archeological sites were identified during this ground\u2010breaking survey. The site of the city of Julian is one of the most remarkable of these. The newly\u2010discovered Julian chahartaq is a fire temple belonging to the Sasanid era. Like many other fire temples of that time, Julian was built with stone and plaster mortar. This chahartaq is the surviving part of the heart of a larger structure, and consists of four stone wall and piers of different sizes surrounded by an ambulatory passageway. READ MORE.",
