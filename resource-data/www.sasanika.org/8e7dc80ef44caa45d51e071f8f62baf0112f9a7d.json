The chaos caused by Mazdakism during his reign lead to a restored, strong, monarchy under his son and successor. Kavad I had two reigns, 488 to 496 and 499 to 531 AD. He succeeded Valkash (484-488) but was soon deposed by his brother Zamasp (496-499). Three years in exile Kavad recovered his throne and was eventually succeeded by his son, one of the most remarkable Sasanian kings, Khusro I (531-579). Kavad had numerous coin types. The one that interests us here is his first type. It was used during his first reign, showing no date, and was then used during the first two years of his second reign, being known for years 11 and 12. A new type was introduced in year 13. <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"http://www. sasanika. org/wp-content/uploads/e-Sasanika11-Gurnet. pdf\" target=\"_blank\">READ MORE</a>. </div></div><div class=\"post-1653 esasanika type-esasanika status-publish format-standard hentry entry\"> <h2 class=\"entry-title\"><a href=\"http://www. sasanika. org/esasanika/inscribed-sasanian-bullae-at-the-national-museum-of-iran/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Inscribed Sasanian Bullae at the National Museum of Iran\">Inscribed Sasanian Bullae at the National Museum of Iran</a></h2><div class=\"author_name tax\">Author: <div class=\"authors\"> Daryoush Akbarzadeh, National Museum of Iran; Touraj Daryaee, University of California, Irvine</div></div><div class=\"entry-content\"> <a href=\"http://www. sasanika. org/esasanika/inscribed-sasanian-bullae-at-the-national-museum-of-iran/\" title=\"Inscribed Sasanian Bullae at the National Museum of Iran\"></a>Sasanian bullae are important objects in understanding the economic and administrative history \u0112r\u0101n\u0161ahr.
