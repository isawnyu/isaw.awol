Shapur I continued the regional policy of his predecessor, Artashir I, from the beginning of his reign. A series of victories against the Roman Empire opened the way to conquer Armenia, which was the main success of Sasanian Iran in the West. Shapur I represented his glorious victories against Roman Empire in rock sculpture and took a new title, king of kings Iran and non\u2010Iran, as a result of his successful policy. <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"http://www. sasanika. org/wp-content/uploads/e-sasanika4-Zohrabyan. pdf\" target=\"_blank\">READ MORE</a>. </div></div><div class=\"post-1625 esasanika type-esasanika status-publish format-standard hentry entry\"> <h2 class=\"entry-title\"><a href=\"http://www. sasanika. org/esasanika/like-father-like-daughter-late-sasanian-imperial-ideology-the-rise-of-boran-to-power-2/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Like Father, Like Daughter: Late Sasanian Imperial Ideology &amp; the Rise of B\u014dr\u0101n to Power\">Like Father, Like Daughter: Late Sasanian Imperial Ideology &amp; the Rise of B\u014dr\u0101n to Power</a></h2><div class=\"author_name tax\">Author: <div class=\"authors\"> Haleh Emrani, University of California, Los Angeles</div></div><div class=\"entry-content\"> <a href=\"http://www. sasanika. org/esasanika/like-father-like-daughter-late-sasanian-imperial-ideology-the-rise-of-boran-to-power-2/\" title=\"Like Father, Like Daughter: Late Sasanian Imperial Ideology &amp; the Rise of B\u014dr\u0101n to Power\"></a>The reign of B\u014dr\u0101n and, afterwards that of her sister \u0100zarm\u012bgduxt, although short\u2010lived, were historically significant.

The significance is even greater in view of the social and cultural limitations placed on women in Sasanian Iran, as discussed in the studies presented by scholars such as Jamsheed K.
