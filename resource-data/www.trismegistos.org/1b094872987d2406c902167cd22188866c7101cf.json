    "description": "[First posted in AWOL 16 September 2009. Most recently updated 23 July 2013] Trismegistos Trismegistos [TM], called after the famous epithet of Hermes - Thoth, the Egyptian god of wisdom and writing who also played a major role in Greek religion and philosophy, is a platform aiming to surmount barriers of language and discipline in the study of texts from the ancient world, particularly late period Egypt and the Nile valley (roughly BC 800 - 800 AD). The core component of TM is Trismegistos Texts, currently counting 165893 entries. When the database was created in 2005, it focused on providing information (metadata) on published papyrological documents from Graeco-Roman Egypt. Chronological boundaries are always artificial, and the nature of the sources soon suggested that BC 800 and AD 800 were more suited. Since egyptology does not know a disciplinary boundary between papyri and inscriptions, TM also decided to expand by adding all epigraphic material as well. Papyrology on the other hand includes also writing tablets from outside Egypt, which led us to widen our geographical scope to the entire ancient world. Finally, since the distinction between published and unpublished is increasingly less productive in a digital environment, we now no longer discriminate in that respect either. In principle, however, we still provide only metadata. This means that Trismegistos increasingly wants to be a platform where information can be found about all texts from antiquity, thus facilitating cross-cultural and cross-linguistic research. This will of course only be possible through cooperation with all players in the field, since our aim is to lead people to the partner websites, where more information, often including also photographs, transliterations and translations of the texts, can be found. Several aspects of the Texts database have been elaborated in the course of successive projects (see History) and have become separate databases linked with the core Trismegistos Texts database. The Collections database, built on the Leuven Homepage of Papyrus Collections, is a set of currently 2530 modern institutional and private collections of texts and their 123,524 inventory numbers. It is searchable both separately and in the Texts database. The Archives database, built on the Leuven Homepage of Papyrus Archives, is a set of currently 464 collections of texts in antiquity, mainly in Egypt, and the 16,461 texts that are part of these archives. It is searchable separately, leading to the texts themselves. The People database, building on the Prosopographia Ptolemaica, is a complex set of prosopographical and onomastic databases. It currently contains 458,045 attestations of personal names of non-royal individuals living in Egypt between BC 800 and AD 800, including all languages and scripts and written on any surface. The Places database, expanding the geographic database of the Fayum project, is a set of currently 14,197 places in (and some outside) Egypt. It contains the currently 113,927 toponyms attested in texts from Egypt (BC 800 \u2013 AD 800), but is also linked to the provenance field in Trismegistos Texts. Finally, because abbreviations are often different in the various disciplines, we have also started creating a Bibliography which resolves many of the short references we use in Trismegistos. The other way round it also wants to facilitate the search for all texts in a specific publication. Its coverage is patchy except for the publications dealing with Demotic and Abnormal Hieratic, where the Demotistische Literatur\u00fcbersicht provides a much higher standard of bibliographic information.
