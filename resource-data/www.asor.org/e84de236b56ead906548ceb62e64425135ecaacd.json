    "description": "Teaching Archaeology to Undergraduates This Forum stems from the session \u201cTeaching Archaeology to Undergraduates and K-12 Schoolchildren\u201d co-chaired by Ellen D. Bedell and Eric H. Cline at the 2010 ASOR Annual Meeting in Atlanta.\u00a0The theme of the 2010 session was the use of technology to teach archaeology. Four of the presentations are being made available on Dig-it-al NEA in hopes that these papers inspire others to incorporate similar techniques and technology into their own curriculum.",
