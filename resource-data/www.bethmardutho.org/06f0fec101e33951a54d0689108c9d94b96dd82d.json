The primary benefit of this new model is that it reduces the amount of time between submission and publication. The <a href=\"http://www. bethmardutho. org/index. php/hugoye/hugoye-pre-publication-drafts. html\" target=\"_self\">Preview Draft page</a> is now up and running, and the first article for Hugoye 16. 2 has already been posted. We hope that both our readers and our authors will find this new policty helpful. </blockquote> Hugoye: Journal of Syriac Studies <blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">The editors of <em>Hugoye: Journal of Syriac Studies</em> are pleased to announce a new publication policy: instead of waiting until January (Issue 1) or July (Issue 2) to release new articles on our webiste, we will add them to a new <a href=\"http://www. bethmardutho. org/index. php/hugoye/hugoye-pre-publication-drafts. html\" target=\"_self\">Preview Draft page</a> as soon as they are ready for publication.
