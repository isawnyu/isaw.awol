    "description": "Analecta Praehistorica Leidensia is the annual journal of the Faculty of Archaeology (formerly the Institute of Prehistory), Leiden University. It was first published in 1964 to present the results of the faculty's archaeological investigations. As such it has become an important source of information for those interested in Neolithic and Iron Age studies in northwestern Europe. In recent years the journal has shifted its focus from site-reports towards contributions which integrate theoretical approaches and archaeological data. Its aim is to publish high quality research, not only pertaining to Dutch prehistory, but also to issues of a wider European scope. The periods covered range from the Paleolithic to the Roman period. All articles will be written either in English, German or French. Contents include monographs as well as compilations of articles; incidentally a volume will be addressed to a thematic issue. Content is free to download after registration.",
