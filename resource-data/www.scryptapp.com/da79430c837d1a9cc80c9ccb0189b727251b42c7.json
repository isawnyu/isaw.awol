    "description": "Scrypt. The Scrypt software is a tool for computer-assisted decipherment of ancient alphabetic inscriptions, enabling the user to choose a set of possible readings for each cell of the inscription, and to automatically launch dictionary searches for selected regions of the text in the Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew dictionary. The name Scrypt is inspired by a fusion of script (as in \u201cancient script\u201d), script (a special kind of computer program) and crypt (as in \u201ccryptography\u201d). Click on a cell to view (and possibly change) its content, and select a continuous range of cells to launch a dictionary search. Finally, just click on a word among the dictionary results, in order to save it in the \"Readings\" panel to the right.",
