Heritage for Peace is a non-profit organization whose mission is to support all Syrians in their efforts to protect and safeguard Syria\u2019s cultural heritage during the armed conflict. As an international group of heritage workers we believe that cultural heritage, and the protection thereof, can be used as a common ground for dialogue and therefore as a tool to enhance peace. We call on all Syrians of any religion or ethnicity to enter into a dialogue and work together to safeguard their mutual heritage.",
