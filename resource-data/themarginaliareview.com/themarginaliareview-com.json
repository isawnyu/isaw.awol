    "description": "Marginalia: A Review of Books in History, Theology and Religion. ISSN: 2325-8357. The Marginalia Review of Books (ISSN 2325-8357) is an international review of academic literature from a range of disciplines along the nexus of history, theology, and religion. We publish reviews on the final Tuesday of every month, and a variety of contributions to intellectual culture - including essays, interviews, and op-eds - throughout the month. MROB aims to enhance the quality of the academic book review, to explore the creative possibilities of the web, and to help authors make their work more easily discoverable than in some traditional journals. We hope to see the academic review in historical, theological, and religious studies move closer to the standard of The Times Literary Supplement or the The New York Review of Books. As a purely digital publication, we have been inspired by The Los Angeles Review of Books. To cite a review from MROB, use the date of publication as it appears on the review and the full name The Marginalia Review of Books. Please also please include the link at the end of whichever format you choose. E. g. : M. Edwards, Review of G. Vermes, Christian Beginnings: From Nazareth to Nicaea AD 30-325. In The Marginalia Review of Books, 29 January 2013. Available online at http://themarginaliareview. com/archives/225.
