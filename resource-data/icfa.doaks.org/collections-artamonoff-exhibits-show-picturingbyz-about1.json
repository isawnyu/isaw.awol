    "description": "Artamonoff: Picturing Byzantine Istanbul 1930-1947. Nicholas V. Artamonoff left behind a photographic puzzle of over 1,000 images. He was a student and engineer, who, while studying and living at Robert College in Istanbul, gained an appreciation for the city\u2019s history and culture. With his Rollei camera, he captured the Byzantine remains, entering the nooks and crannies of the fortifications and cisterns. He strolled through the city in the footsteps of architectural historians and archaeologists who explored and uncovered Byzantine Istanbul. His interests were broad: from imposing churches to the smallest details of architectural sculpture, from bustling marketplaces to the diligent work of lone craftsmen. This abundance of subjects makes the Nicholas V. Artamonoff Collection rich and engaging, providing a glimpse into the diverse urban environment in which he lived, and into the versatile photographer he was.",
