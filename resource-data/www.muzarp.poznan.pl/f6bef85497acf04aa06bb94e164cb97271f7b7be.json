The Nile Delta as a centre of cultural interactions between Upper Egypt and the Southern Levant in 4 th millennium BC The Nile Delta as a centre of cultural interactions between Upper Egypt and the Southern Levant in 4 th millennium BC, edited by A. M\u0105czy\u0144ska, Studies in African Archaeology, vol. 13, Pozna\u0144, 2014. This volume is part of and concludes the project entitled The Nile Delta as a centre of cultural interactions between Upper Egypt and the Southern Levant in 4 th millennium BC. It contains a collection of papers by researchers involved in investigating the development of the Nile Delta in the Pre- and Protodynastic Periods. Nearly all of these papers were presented at the same-titled conference held on June 21 and 22, 2013 in the Archeological Museum in Pozna\u0144, Poland. Although originally planned as a workshop presenting the results of research carried out as part of the project, the conference eventually evolved into a major event and became an opportunity to meet and talk about the role of Delta communities in the development of the Egyptian civilization in the 4 th millennium BC, with particular emphasis on their relations with neighboring areas, i. e. the Southern Levant and Upper Egypt. The conference was attended both by project partners and by invited guests whose papers made an excellent addition to the main topic of the event. Only the paper by Steven Rosen was presented at a workshop called Imports during the Naqada Period: Investigating Two Sides of a Phenomenon organized by W. F. Albright Institute of Archaeological Research in Jerusalem on November 26, 2012. The main goal of the workshop was to meet Israeli archeologists, who keep finding Egyptian imports on various sites. An important element of the workshop was the opportunity to discuss Egyptian-Levantine relationships not only from the Egyptian, but also from the Levantine perspective. The article by Steven Rosen is a fine example here.",
