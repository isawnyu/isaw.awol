Its 460 colour pages, organised in 27 chapters, contain not just the artefacts found at the site, but also their wider interpretation complemented with the results of specialised analyses. The publication was prepared as part of the promotion of the project entitled \"The Nile Delta as a centre of cultural exchange between the Upper Egypt and the south Levantin the 4th millennium B. C. \", financed by the Foundation for Polish Science under the Pomost-Powroty Programme. The volume is not meant for sale. The whole circulation will be distributed among scholars studying Egyptian archaeology, and will be dispatched to libraries at home and abroad with which the Library of the Pozna\u0144 Archaeologica lMuseumhas an exchange programme.",
