    "description": "Micropasts: A community platform for conducting, designing and funding research into our human past is a web platform that brings together\u00a0full-time archaeologists, archaeological societies and other interested members of the public to collaborate on new kinds of research about our human history. It is a place where archaeological enthusiasts not only can create high-quality research data together, but also can\u00a0collaboratively design and fund entirely new research projects.\u00a0In particular, we want to encourage better kinds of archaeology by improving the ways that people traditionally distinguished as \u2018academics\u2019, \u2018professionals\u2019 and \u2018volunteers\u2019 cooperate with one another\u00a0(as well as with others out there who as yet have\u00a0no more than a passing interest in archaeology). Through the\u00a0 platform, we will develop and support a range of crowd-sourcing and crowd-funding\u00a0projects. By joining, you can help research, fund and/or design as many projects as you like, with as much or as little personal commitment as you wish. Some existing projects are about creating 3D models of archaeological artefacts, enriching old photographic archives or transcribing old archaeological excavation records, to name just a few that we have come up with so far. Other new projects will need your help with financing before they can begin, whilst yet others might be research topics that you want \u00a0to propose yourself (as an individual, as part of an organised archaeological society or in tandem with other interested people that you meet online).\u00a0We cannot yet say \u00a0which projects will prove popular and which ones will not, and we hope that many as yet unanticipated agendas will be\u00a0dreamt up collectively. In any case, we are keen for your ideas and your contributions wherever we can get them! This project\u2019s initial stages have been funded by a UK Arts and Humanities Research Council grant, and involve a collaboration between the UCL Institute of Archaeology, The British Museum and the Portable Antiquities Scheme.\u00a0The platform is currently under construction and we will be adding content and functionality over the coming few months. If you would like to be put on a list of early possible contributors, then please contact us.",
