    "description": "The Vatican Museums originated as a group of sculptures collected by Pope Julius II (1503-1513) and placed in what today is the \u0093Cortile Ottagono\u0094 within the museum complex. The popes were among the first sovereigns who opened the art collections of their palaces to the public thus promoting knowledge of art history and culture. As seen today, the Vatican Museums are a complex of different pontifical museums and galleries that began under the patronage of the popes Clement XIV (1769-1774) and Pius VI (1775-1799). In fact, the Pio-Clementine Museum was named after these two popes, who set up this first major curatorial section. Later, Pius VII (1800-1823) considerably expanded the collections of Classical Antiquities, to which he added the Chiaromonti Museum and the \u0093Braccio Nuovo\u0094 gallery. He also enriched the Epigraphic Collection, which was conserved in the Lapidary Gallery. Gregory XVI (1831-1846) founded the Etruscan Museum (1837) with archaeological finds discovered during excavations carried out from 1828 onwards in southern Etruria. Later, he established the Egyptian Museum (1839), which houses ancient artifacts from explorations in Egypt, together with other pieces already conserved in the Vatican and in the Museo Capitolino, and the Lateran Profane Museum (1844), with statues, bas-relief sculptures and mosaics of the Roman era, which could not be adequately placed in the Vatican Palace...Gregorian Egyptian Museum\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gregorian Etruscan Museum",
