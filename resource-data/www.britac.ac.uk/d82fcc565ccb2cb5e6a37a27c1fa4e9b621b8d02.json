The Achaemenid period in the Levant is generally considered an obscure part of history. However, since 1980, epigraphic discoveries and research have thrown new light on this period. A variety of aspects will be presented across three evening lectures on this subject. Tuesday 25 June 2013Levantine Epigraphy and Phoenicia: the kingdoms of Byblos, Sidon and Tyre during the Achaemenid period The Persian \"king of kings\" had to rely on the Phoenician navy in his wars against Greece in the Eastern Mediterranean and Phoenicia played the most important part in the satrapy of \u2018Avar-Nahara. Since 1980, the dates of important royal Sidonian inscriptions have been revised and various new inscriptions from Byblos, Sidon and Tyre as well as new numismatic studies have been published. They shed new light on the history and extent of the Phoenician kingdoms, especially on their relations with Palestine.",
