    "description": "The Archaeology SIG aims to encourage the exchange of research and methodology between remote sensing scientists and archaeologists, especially those concerned with methods of site prospection and novel applications. Meetings concentrate on a mixture of case studies and developing methodology and include ground-based methods, photogrammetry, LIDAR, laser scanning, and geophysical prospection, as well as aerial photography and thermal imaging.SIG ActivitiesThe Archaeology Special Interest Group of the Remote Sensing and Photogrammetry Society aims to:Promote the development & use of remote sensing in archaeological surveyingEncourage research in all aspects of remote site location and interpretationProvide a forum for the exchange of information & ideasCurrent areas of interest include the following:Satellite data interpretationAerial photographic analysisDigital image processingGround-based applicationsHigh-resolution photographic techniquesRadarThermal line scanningGISUAVs Newsletter Spring 2013 Newsletter Spring 2012 Newsletter Spring 2011 Newsletter Autumn 2010",
