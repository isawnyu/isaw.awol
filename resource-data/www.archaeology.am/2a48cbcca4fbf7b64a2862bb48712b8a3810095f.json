    "description": "British Council, an organization disseminating the United Kingdom\u2019s experience and creative vision in science, arts and education. The British Council Office in Yerevan responded generously to a plea for funding and enabled the scientists to acquire a two-person paramotor (powered parawing) for aerial exploration. Wings over Armenia is a pioneering programme within the states of the former Soviet Union. Its first stage will include systematic aerial survey and photography of the Kasach gorge area - 400 sq km of foothills and plains 20 km northwest of Yerevan. The project area includes known sites dating back as far as the Bronze Age, along with features such as field systems and road networks that can be effectively recorded from the air. Another element of the programme will be field visits to possible sites detected on 1970s satellite imagery [links to publications in AARGnews and Eurisy], and during the project\u2019s own aerial survey. Results from Wings over Armenia will thus add immediately to the knowledge already known to Armenian archaeologists through field investigation and excavation.",
