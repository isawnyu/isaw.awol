    "description": "[First posted 10/31/10, most recently updated 8 February 2015]. \u2018Atiqot. [Open Access after registration]. 'Atiqot is the refereed journal of the Israel Antiquities Authority. It is published four times a year. The contents of the printed version is uploaded to the e-journal website. No changes are made to articles post-publication. The printed journal is available via the IAA website. For details on how to submit, see our Guide to Contributors. Range of Topics. \u2018Atiqot covers a large chronological span, from prehistory up to the Ottoman period. Excavations are studied from various aspects and disciplines-often the result of the close interaction between researchers of the IAA and outside specialists. Thus, a report should include, in addition to the stratigraphic analysis, comprehensive treatments of the archaeological data, including studies of the various groups of finds, such as ceramics, glass, stone and metal objects, coins, jewelry, textiles, etc. , as well as the geological, botanical, faunal and anthropological evidence. Laboratory analyses, such as petrography, radiocarbon dating and metallurgy, should be included where relevant. The archaeological data published in \u2018Atiqot are not confined to a specific range of periods or topics, but to a geographical area-the Land of Israel-which has been influenced by almost every ancient culture that existed in the Levant. The journal thus presents comprehensive research on the region and its connections with the neighboring countries. The publication is devoted to final reports and shorter articles, although occasionally a volume is dedicated to a particular topic (e. g. , burial caves, agricultural installations), period (e. g. , prehistoric, Islamic) or site (e. g. , Acre, Jerusalem). Excavation Reports. The papers published in \u2018Atiqot are primarily the result of salvage excavations conducted by the IAA. Their results are sometimes unexpectedly important, filling in gaps that could not be understood by localized studies of the larger tells. \u2018Atiqot is one of the few vehicles for imparting this important data and therefore a primary asset to any scholar in archaeology. Bilingual Journal. The journal is bilingual, publishing articles in English or Hebrew; all Hebrew reports are accompanied by English summaries keyed to illustrations in the main text.
