    "description": "[First posted in AWOL 1 July 2011. Most recently updated 10 February 2013]. Transcultural Studies is a peer-reviewed, open-access journal committed to promoting the knowledge and research of transculturality in an interdisciplinary context. Initiated in 2010, it is published by the Cluster of Excellence \"Asia and Europe in a Global Context: Shifting Asymmetries and Cultural Flows\" at the Ruprecht-Karls-Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg and hosted by the University Library of the same institution. As an e-journal, Transcultural Studies provides contributors with a number of advantages not available in traditional printed form. High definition images, sounds, and videos may be included for an enriched textual experience. If contributors wish, an additional Wiki-platform can be added to allow readers to debate, comment on, and supplement the published materials. Transcultural Studies does not limit word count and accepts a range of literary forms, from scholarly investigations with extensive documentation to scholarly articles, films, translations of scholarly works, and review essays. While contributions are written in English, vernacular scripts are added if necessary. Transcultural Studies strongly invites contributions from scholars working on topics related to or concerning the study of transculturality. Submissions will be published in the order in which they are accepted until the issue is closed; there will be two issues per year. Previous Issues:.",
