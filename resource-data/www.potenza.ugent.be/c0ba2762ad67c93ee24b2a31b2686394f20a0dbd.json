    "description": "POTENZA Valley Project. In 2000 a team of Ghent University (Belgium), under the direction of Prof. Frank Vermeulen, started a very intensive survey of an Adriatic valley. Denominated 'Potenza Valley Survey' (PVS), this research project aims at measuring the evolution of social complexity during Antiquity in a specific part of Central Italy. The fieldwork operations in the valley of the river Potenza included systematic archaeological field walking, active aerial photography, artefact studies, re-study of excavated evidence, detailed geomorphologic field mapping, geophysical surveys and topographic analysis. During the years these interdisciplinary and mostly non-invasive approaches allowed to obtain a new holistic synthesis of the occupation history in this territory, with a special emphasis on the protohistoric, Roman and early medieval periods. This website wants to take the PVS online, by offering up-to-date information on the aims of the project, the methodologies applied and the results gained. As frequently as possible, this site will be updated with more texts, maps and pictures. So please check regularly.",
