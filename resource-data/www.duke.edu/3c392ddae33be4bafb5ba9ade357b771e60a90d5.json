    "description": "on-line on the GRBS website, on terms of free access. We undertake this transformation in the hope of affording our authors a wider readership; out of concern for the financial state of our libraries; and in the belief that the dissemination of knowledge should be free. The current process of submission and peer-review of papers will continue unchanged. The on-line format will be identical with our pages as now printed, and so articles will continue to be cited by volume, year, and page numbers. Our hope is that both authors and readers will judge this new medium to be to their advantage, and that such open access will be of benefit to continuing scholar\u00acship on Greece. \u2013 The editors This is an excellent move and they are to be congratulated!",
