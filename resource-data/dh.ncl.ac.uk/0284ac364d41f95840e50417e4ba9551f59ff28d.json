    "description": "Inscripta is an e-learning resource aimed at teaching students to transcribe, transliterate and translate Romano-British inscriptions. The website provides an introduction to, and an online seminar on, about fifty Latin inscriptions, using examples from the collection held in the Great North Museum, Newcastle upon Tyne. The information on each inscription features an image, the Latin text, an English translation, audio files with the recordings of Latin and English texts, some general information on the chronology and archaeological context, and - as appropriate - some general comment on the historical significance of the inscription. The material is broadly divided into three categories: building inscriptions, altars, and tombstones. The material is ordered according to difficulty and the seminar ends with the discussion of some problematic case-studies from each category. This website has been constructed by Glyn Goodrick, Lindsay Allason-Jones and Federico Santangelo at the Centre for Interdisciplinary Artefact Studies, School of Historical Studies, Newcastle University, with funding from Classics in the Higher Education Academy Subject Centre. INSTRUCTIONS To use Inscripta: click on a category in the left panel [below]. The inscriptions in each category are arranged in order of difficulty. Click on the RIB number under each thumbnail image in the top bar to reveal the text and a larger image. If you wish to see the Latin text with the missing letters in brackets, run your cursor over the Latin text. You may find you can\u2019t get the brackets if there are restrictions on your computer. Check the tool bar for \u2018Click for options\u2019 and then click on \u2018Allow Blocked Content\u2019. Whether you can hear the voice-over will also depend on your computer. To translate the text, click on Translate and write your translation in the blank box. When you are happy with your efforts, click on Submit and the correct translation will appear on the right. Further information about inscriptions is available by clicking on the headings in the left panel.",
