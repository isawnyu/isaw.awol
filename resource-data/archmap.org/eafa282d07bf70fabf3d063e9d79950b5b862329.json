Mapping Mesopotamian Monuments presents a topographical survey of the standing historical and architectural remains in the region from Kurdistan to southern Iraq. A work in progress, this monument survey covers all historical periods from ancient to modern. It includes ancient Mesopotamian rock reliefs carved into the cliff faces of the mountains, early Christian churches and monasteries, early Islamic, Ottoman and twentieth century architecture. The database of images invites you to explore the multiple layers of the rich historical landscape of Mesopotamia. Envisioned and directed by Professor Zainab Bahrani, the basis of the survey is a field project that assesses the condition of monuments, maps their locations, and records them with digital techniques to provide a record and to facilitate future preservation and conservation work across this land. In the first season (2013) the team documented the major monuments and historical architecture of the Dohuk region and the city of Erbil, one of the oldest continuously inhabited sites in the world.",
