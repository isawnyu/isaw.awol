    "description": "In the early part of the 1990\u2032s, while at university, I embarked on creating a set of Mandaic computer fonts with the aim of reproducing the then hand written or microfilmed surviving Mandaic texts into printed format. The printed format has marked advantages over the handwritten texts including easy editing, clearer more consistent and reproducible text. In 1998 we completed the reproduction of the Ginza Rba, to my knowledge, at the time this was the first work of its kind. Today, my work with the reproduction of the Mandaic publications continues \u2013 without the associated noise, the back slapping or pomp and ceremony of my contemporaries. In the following pages I have provided PDF copies of the Mandaic texts reproduced thus far. These texts are available in other formats both electronic and hardcopy. Please contact me if more information is required...",
