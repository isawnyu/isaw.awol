    "description": "Expositions: Interdisciplinary Studies in the Humanities. is an on-line journal where scholars from multiple disciplines gather as colleagues to converse about common texts and questions in the humanities. Acting on the Augustinian principle that nothing human is foreign to the sympathetic heart, we seek articles, interdisciplinary exchanges, and briefer notes and insights that benefit teaching, research, and the life of the academy. provides immediate open access to its content on the principle that making research freely available to the public supports a greater global exchange of knowledge.
