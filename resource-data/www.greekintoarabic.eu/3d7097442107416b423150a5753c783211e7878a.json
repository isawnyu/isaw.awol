    "description": "\"A servizio della verit\u00e0\": Didimo il Cieco 'lettore' di Aristotele The present survey investigates the quotations, references, and mentions of Aristotle\u2019s name and the use of his doctrines in Didymus the Blind\u2019s writings. It is clear from this that the latter had direct knowledge of the Organon and probably also of the Nicomachean Ethics. It is also possible that Didymus had studied other works of Aristotle, but there is less evidence of this. Almost all of the explicit quotations are found in the commentaries on the Psalms and the Ecclesiastes, i.e. in Didymus\u2019 lectures; on the contrary, the commentaries composed to circulate in written form make no explicit reference to Aristotle. Studia graeco-arabica 2 / 2012. In memoriam Alain-Philippe Segonds Le corpus aristot\u00e9licien du Paris gr. 1853 et les cercles \u00e9rudits \u00e0 Byzance Parisinus gr. 1853, a key witness to the Corpus Aristotelicum, is usually believed to be the medieval copy of an ancient Corpus. Nevertheless, the analysis of its codicological, paleographic and textual features strongly suggests that it is built up out of smaller items, probably copied in different milieux from different exemplars, and combined in a single manuscript by an unknown scholar in tenth century Constantinople.",
