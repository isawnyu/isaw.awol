    "description": "Les antiquit\u00e9s gr\u00e9co-romaines entre al-Mak\u012bn ibn al-\u02bfAm\u012bd et ibn \u1e2aald\u016bn The Coptic Historian al-Mak\u012bn \u01e6ir\u01e7is ibn al-\u02bfAm\u012bd (1206 - after 1280) is the author of a universal history known as al-Ma\u01e7m\u016b\u02bf al-Mub\u0101rak (\u2018The blessed collection\u2019). This work is divided into two parts: a section on pre-Islamic history, still unpublished, and a summary of Islamic history, edited by Erpenius in 1625 and completed by Claude Cahen. The article analyzes the two recensions of the first part of the Ma\u01e7m\u016b\u02bf through the comparison of three manuscripts, in particular as regards the sections on Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine history. After discussing the particular version of the Testimonium Flavianum which can be found in the longer recension of the Ma\u01e7m\u016b\u02bf, the article traces the fortune of al-Mak\u012bn in subsequent Islamic historiography, especially al-Qalqa\u0161and\u012b, al-Maqr\u012bz\u012b and Ibn \u1e2aald\u016bn. Studia graeco-Arabica 3 / 2013 Griechische Wissenschaft in arabischer Sprache. Ein griechisch-arabisches Fachw\u00f6rterbuch der internationalenWissensgesellschaft im klassischen Islam The project \u201cGlossarium Graeco-Arabicum\u201d was launched in 1980 at the Seminar f\u00fcr Orientalistik und Islamwissenschaft (Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum, Germany). First supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation) for several years, it forms since 2010 a part of the ERC Project Ideas \u201cGreek into Arabic. Philosophical Concepts and Linguistic Bridges\u201d (Advanced Grant 249431). The object of the project \u201cGlossarium Graeco-Arabicum\u201d is to make available the lexical, grammatical and conceptual content of the Arabic translations of Greek scientific and philosophical works, made from the eighth to the tenth century A.D., and forming the basis of the scientific activity in Mediaeval Islam. A group organized by Gerhard Endress (Bochum) and working in cooperation with Dimitri Gutas (Yale University, New Haven, Conn.) compiled the lexical materials first on index cards (ca. 80,000), and then started to prepare the Greek and Arabic Lexicon, presenting the lexical data in a rationalized and systematic way. This is published in print by E.J. Brill since 1992. The online Database \u201cGlossarium Gr\u00e6co-Arabicum\u201d makes available the files which have not yet been published in the analytical reference dictionary GALex, and comprises Arabic roots from the letter \u01e7\u012bm to the end of the Arabic alphabet. The database provides search facilities for Greek words, Arabic words and roots, as well as the authors and titles of the source texts.",
