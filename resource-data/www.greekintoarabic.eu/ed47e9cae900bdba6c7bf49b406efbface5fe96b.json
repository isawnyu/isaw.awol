    "description": "Alexander of Aphrodisias in Themistius\u2019 Paraphrase of the De Caelo This paper examines some fragments of Alexander of Aphrodisias\u2019 lost commentary on Aristotle\u2019s De Caelo preserved in Themistius\u2019 paraphrase of this work. Its aim is to make available the list of Themistius\u2019 explicit quotations of Alexander on the basis of the Hebrew text of the paraphrase, checked against the manuscript Firenze, Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale, II.II.528. It also examines in detail a selection of these passages. It will appear that some of Alexander\u2019s fragments, as preserved by Themistius, can be recovered in their original wording and meaning only on the basis of the Hebrew text. The first two passages, discussed in section 1, are meant to substantiate this claim. The third passage, discussed in section 2, raises a doctrinal question. In the Appendix, I provide a list of Alexander\u2019s passages explicitly quoted by Themistius. For each quotation, the reference to the folios and lines of the Florence MS is given. This is especially necessary, in consideration of the differences between the Hebrew text as edited and as preserved in the MSS. Studia graeco-arabica 2 / 2012. In memoriam Alain-Philippe Segonds Un n\u00e9ophyte entre l\u2019Italie et la France au milieu du XVIe si\u00e8cle: la \u201cR\u00e9ponse de Ludovico Carretto \u00e0 un talmudiste\u201d (ms. Paris BnF h\u00e9br. 753, ff. 1r-19v) This article deals with some aspects of the intellectual activity of the Jew convert to Christianity Ludovico Carretto (alias Todros ha-Cohen, c.1500 - post 1553), especially by examining and editing previously unstudied manuscript material. The author reconstructs some aspects of Carretto\u2019s philosophic and kabbalist background, suggesting his dependence from Christian authors as Francesco Zorzi, Petrus Galatin or Cornelius Agrippa. The study of Carretto\u2019s response to an anonymous Jew contained in the ms. Paris BnF h\u00e9br. 753 brings to light some new pieces of information on Jewish reaction to the Christian use of Hebrew texts.",
