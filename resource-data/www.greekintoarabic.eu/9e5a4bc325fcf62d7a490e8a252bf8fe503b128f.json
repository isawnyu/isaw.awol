    "description": "Due note a Plotino: Enneadi IV 7[2], 8.2 e V 9[5], 12 This article aims to show how, in two different passages, the text attested by the Medieval sources can be retained, notwithstanding the doubts of several scholars who tried to amend it. A closer look at the text and its syntax allows the reader to follow the course of Plotinus\u2019 arguments and to reach a better understanding of their meaning. Studia graeco-arabica 2 / 2012. In memoriam Alain-Philippe Segonds Nota su partecipazione e atto d'essere nel neoplatonismo: l'anonimo Commento al \"Parmenide\" The anonymous commentator on Plato\u2019s \"Parmenides\" provides a sophisticated interpretation of Plat., Parm. 142 B 5-6, in which he aims to show that the One-Being can (under certain conditions) be thought to participate in the first One above Being (Anonym., In Parm., XI-XII). In doing so, the commentator sets out two different explanations of the verb \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd. The first explanation is closely reminiscent of the Peripatetic doctrine of essential predication, whereas the second one may contain an adaptation of the Stoic lekt\u00f3n (a theory which Longinus, Porphyry\u2019s first master, significantly linked to the theory of Ideas).",
