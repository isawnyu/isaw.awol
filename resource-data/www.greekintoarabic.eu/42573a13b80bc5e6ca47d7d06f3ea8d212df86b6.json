    "description": "Sur la lecture tardo-antique du Peri Hermeneias d\u2019Aristote: Paul le Perse et la tradition d\u2019\u200aAmmonius The aim of this paper is to provide the critical edition, with translation and commentary, of a short Syriac treatise by Paul the Persian (6th century) about Aristotle\u2019s Peri Hermeneias. The text is edited from a unique manuscript, preserved in a convent near Mosul (Iraq): Notre-Dame des Semences 53. The commentary examines in detail Paul\u2019s Syriac text by comparison with the Greek commentaries by Ammonius and Stephanus on the Peri Hermeneias. From this comparison, the evident influence of the Greek Ammonian tradition on the Syro-oriental philosophical milieu will become clear. The study will also substantiate the claim that, in Paul\u2019s eyes, the treatise of Aristotle does not deal with propositions, seen as the components of the syllogism, but with the contradictory pairs of propositions. Moreover, Paul approaches the analysis of contradiction by interpreting the propositions in terms of their material subject. Studia graeco-arabica 3 / 2013 Ismailiti a Bisanzio. Immagini e presenze In recent past the already abundant bibliography on the Ism\u0101\u2018\u012bl\u012b Niz\u0101r\u012b sect, known in the Western world since the 12th century with the inappropriate and hostile definition of \u2018Assassins sect\u2019, was enriched by fundamental contributions of Farhad Daftary, co-director and head of the Department of Academic Research and Publications at the Institute of Ismaili Studies. However, in his work are not even mentioned some Byzantine sources on the sect, which are of considerable interest, and that scholarship has taken into account only seldom. The present paper can be regarded as a sort of small Appendix to Daftary\u2019s work. It consists of two distinct parts: the first is dedicated to the image of the Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012bs in the Byzantine sources (Anna Comnena, John Phokas and Niketas Choniates); the second one is an analysis of the dossier concerning a Fatimid d\u0101\u2018\u012b sent to Constantinople.",
