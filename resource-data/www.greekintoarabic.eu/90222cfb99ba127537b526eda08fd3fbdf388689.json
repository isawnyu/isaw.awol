    "description": "La struttura del De Anima di Giamblico Iamblichus\u2019 philosophic positions are increasingly studied nowadays, after having been clouded by his religious claims in favour of \u2018theurgy\u2019. The De Anima proves to be crucial in order to evaluate his philosophy. However, this work is only fragmentarily recorded, in the order given by Stobaeus. This article advances a new tentative order of the fragments, different from Festugi\u00e8re\u2019s one, that is endorsed in the 2002 edition by Finamore and Dillon. Studia graeco-arabica 2 / 2012. In memoriam Alain-Philippe Segonds \"A servizio della verit\u00e0\": Didimo il Cieco 'lettore' di Aristotele The present survey investigates the quotations, references, and mentions of Aristotle\u2019s name and the use of his doctrines in Didymus the Blind\u2019s writings. It is clear from this that the latter had direct knowledge of the Organon and probably also of the Nicomachean Ethics. It is also possible that Didymus had studied other works of Aristotle, but there is less evidence of this. Almost all of the explicit quotations are found in the commentaries on the Psalms and the Ecclesiastes, i.e. in Didymus\u2019 lectures; on the contrary, the commentaries composed to circulate in written form make no explicit reference to Aristotle.",
