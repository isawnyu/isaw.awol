    "description": "Il manoscritto Ambrosiano arabo \"& 105 sup.\" e la trasmissione delle opere di logica greca in arabo This article contains general remarks on the manuscript & 105 sup. preserved in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana, Milan. It contains (i) a version of Porphyry\u2019s \"Isagoge\"; (ii) a titleless text; and (iii) a treatise \"On virtues\" considered as pseudo-Aristotelian by R. Traini. The translation of the \"Isagoge\" is anonymous and defective. Up to now, al-Dima\u0161q\u012b\u2019s translation is known, which Ab\u016b l-Fara\u01e7 ibn al-\u1e6cayyib may have used for his commentary, recognized in the Bodleian manuscript Marsh 28. The version provided in the Ambrosiana manuscript seems to differ from al-Dima\u0161q\u012b\u2019s, and may be earlier. A solution to the problem is found in the second text contained in the manuscript. It is a translation of the \"De Interpretatione\" up to 17 b 14, and it perfectly coincides with the fragment in the Berlin manuscript Syr. 88, edited by Hoffmann in 1869. The identity between these texts that appear as testimonies of a version different from the one by Is\u1e25\u0101q ibn \u1e24unayn, and directly derived from Syriac, allows to hypothesize that the \u2018Porphyrius Ambrosianus\u2019 can also be a copy of the version of the Isagoge preserved in the Berlin manuscript, as is shown by some formal and stylistic similarities. Further studies will establish whether the authorship of these versions can be reported to a single author, who may have influenced Is\u1e25\u0101q ibn \u1e24unayn. The numerous similarities of the \u2018Porphyrius Ambrosianus\u2019 with Ibn al-\u1e6cayyib are also remarkable: the latter may have known that version. It is to be noted, finally, that the third text contained in the Ambrosiana manuscript is also linked to Ibn al-\u1e6cayyib, and is found in the Berlin manuscript too. The Ambrosiana manuscript might be a partial copy of the manuscript Syr. 88. Studia graeco-arabica 2 / 2012. In memoriam Alain-Philippe Segonds Un\u2019\u200aistituzione sasanide? Il Bayt al-\u1e25ikma e il movimento di traduzione The nature and precise activitiy of the bayt al-\u1e25ikma (House of Wisdom) is matter of debate. Earlier scholarship connected to it the translations from Greek of scientific and philosophical works, a position challenged by D.\u00a0Gutas, who presents this library as a part of the Sasanian administrative apparatus adopted under the early \u2018Abb\u0101sids with no direct involvement in the translations from Greek. This paper claims that there is no hard evidence pointing to a Sasanian origin of this institution, and contends that some scholars working in it had an active role in the translation movement from Greek into Arabic.",
