    "description": "Scol\u00ee medievali e tradizione antica. This paper examines the relationship between some scholia to the IIId book of Plato\u2019s Republic, Proclus\u2019 commentary on it, and the so-called Chrestomathia, a work that the manuscripts attribute to the Neoplatonic philosopher himself. The conclusion is that the relationship between the three texts is highly problematic, and that we cannot think of a simple and direct derivation from one another. The author of the scholia probably made use of texts different from those that have come down to us, or alternatively he has reworked his sources in a personal way. Studia graeco-arabica 1 / 2011 Platonic and Neoplatonic Terminology for Being in Arabic translation. The Arabic version of the Enneads is the earliest datable text in which appears the term \"anniyya\", that features in Avicenna\u2019s metaphysics and lies in the background of the Latin definition of the Causa prima as esse tantum, typical of the Liber de Causis. This paper examines some examples of the use of \"to be\" in the Arabic translation of the Enneads. It also discusses the description of the First Cause as \u2018pure Being\u2019 or \u2018first Being\u2019 in the Arabic Plotinus, and compares it with the Divine Names of the pseudo-Dionysius.",
