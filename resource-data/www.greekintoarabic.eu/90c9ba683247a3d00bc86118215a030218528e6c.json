    "description": "Il concetto di 'essere' dall\u2019Aristotele greco alla lingua araba. The problem of the translation into Arabic of the Greek philosophical terminology and in particular of the verb 'to be', and the reflection on the possible conditioning that every natural language can operate in a completely unconscious way in thinking and in the formulation of concepts was faced by Arabic-speaking philosophers well before by the modern linguists. By analyzing the Arabic direct and indirect tradition of \"Metaphysics Delta\" 7, in which Aristotle speaks of the different meanings of being, \u03c4\u1f78 \u1f44\u03bd, this study tries to test the awareness of these problems in the early translators of Greek philosophical and scientific heritage into Arabic language, such as the Christian Us\u1e6d\u0101\u1e6f, translator of the circle of al-Kind\u012b, and in the following generations of philosophers such as al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, Avicenna and Averroes. Studia graeco-arabica 2 / 2012. In memoriam Alain-Philippe Segonds 'Sostanza', 'Essenza' e 'Quiddit\u00e0' nelle diverse lingue delle letterature filosofiche medievali: una proposta di comparazione storico-linguistica. The linguistic history of three main Aristotelian philosophical terms, \u2018substance\u2019, \u2018essence\u2019 and \u2018quiddity\u2019, in the Medieval written languages of Europe and of Near and Middle East has not yet been reconstructed in detail. Here, a tentative reconstruction of it is suggested, through a comparison of their different use in Syriac, Coptic, Classical Ethiopic (ge\u2018ez), Armenian, Georgian, Arabic, Middle Persian, Sogdian and Sanskrit, as well as in Latin and Medieval Hebrew. From this reconstruction, the evident influence of Greek on European and Near Eastern philosophical terminology is clear, but also the probable influence of some Sanskrit and Middle Persian terms on Medieval Arabic philosophical language is pointed out.",
