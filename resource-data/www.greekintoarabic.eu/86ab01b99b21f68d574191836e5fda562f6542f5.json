    "description": "Le corpus aristot\u00e9licien du Paris gr. 1853 et les cercles \u00e9rudits \u00e0 Byzance Parisinus gr. 1853, a key witness to the Corpus Aristotelicum, is usually believed to be the medieval copy of an ancient Corpus. Nevertheless, the analysis of its codicological, paleographic and textual features strongly suggests that it is built up out of smaller items, probably copied in different milieux from different exemplars, and combined in a single manuscript by an unknown scholar in tenth century Constantinople. Studia graeco-arabica 2 / 2012. In memoriam Alain-Philippe Segonds Le commentaire syriaque de Probus sur l\u2019Isagoge de Porphyre. Une \u00e9tude pr\u00e9liminaire The commentary on Porphyry\u2019s \"Isagoge\" by Probus (VIth century) is the only one important Syriac commentary preserved of that period, but the major part of the text remained so far inedited. The aim of this paper is to set out the whole text from the manuscripts and to give an idea of its contents by putting it in its historical context. The paper examines briefly the relationship between Probus\u2019 commentary and the Greek commentaries by Ammonius, Elias and David, and shows that the Syriac text fits into the Alexandrian tradition.",
