    "description": "Ismailiti a Bisanzio. Immagini e presenze In recent past the already abundant bibliography on the Ism\u0101\u2018\u012bl\u012b Niz\u0101r\u012b sect, known in the Western world since the 12th century with the inappropriate and hostile definition of \u2018Assassins sect\u2019, was enriched by fundamental contributions of Farhad Daftary, co-director and head of the Department of Academic Research and Publications at the Institute of Ismaili Studies. However, in his work are not even mentioned some Byzantine sources on the sect, which are of considerable interest, and that scholarship has taken into account only seldom. The present paper can be regarded as a sort of small Appendix to Daftary\u2019s work. It consists of two distinct parts: the first is dedicated to the image of the Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012bs in the Byzantine sources (Anna Comnena, John Phokas and Niketas Choniates); the second one is an analysis of the dossier concerning a Fatimid d\u0101\u2018\u012b sent to Constantinople. Studia graeco-arabica 3 / 2013 Les antiquit\u00e9s gr\u00e9co-romaines entre al-Mak\u012bn ibn al-\u02bfAm\u012bd et ibn \u1e2aald\u016bn The Coptic Historian al-Mak\u012bn \u01e6ir\u01e7is ibn al-\u02bfAm\u012bd (1206 - after 1280) is the author of a universal history known as al-Ma\u01e7m\u016b\u02bf al-Mub\u0101rak (\u2018The blessed collection\u2019). This work is divided into two parts: a section on pre-Islamic history, still unpublished, and a summary of Islamic history, edited by Erpenius in 1625 and completed by Claude Cahen. The article analyzes the two recensions of the first part of the Ma\u01e7m\u016b\u02bf through the comparison of three manuscripts, in particular as regards the sections on Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine history. After discussing the particular version of the Testimonium Flavianum which can be found in the longer recension of the Ma\u01e7m\u016b\u02bf, the article traces the fortune of al-Mak\u012bn in subsequent Islamic historiography, especially al-Qalqa\u0161and\u012b, al-Maqr\u012bz\u012b and Ibn \u1e2aald\u016bn.",
