    "description": "Annotations in collaborative environments. This article discusses methodological aspects of the Greek into Arabic Web Application related to the annotation system. Collaborative environments for the philological studies manage multiple versions both of the reference edition with digital variants and of linguistic and exegetical annotations. The system must verify and maintain the consistency of interrelated information, which can change asynchronously. Strategies to align different versions of texts and annotations, in order to update the internal references and notify the users to verify the content consistency, are illustrated. Structural aspects that involve the granularity and overlapping of annotations are discussed, taking into account also that linguistic annotations automatically generated by morphological parsers can be the basis for extended comments in natural language. Finally, the article illustrates which features related to the annotation system are yet implemented in the G2A Web Application. Studia graeco-arabica 3 / 2013 Computational contributions for Arabic language processing Part I. The automatic morphologic analysis of Arabic texts. The aim of this paper is to describe our work on the project \u201cGreek into Arabic\u201d, in which we faced some problems of ambiguity inherent to the Arabic language. Difficulties arose in the various stages of automatic processing of the Arabic version of Plotinus, the text which lies at the core of our project. Part I highlights the needs that led us to update the morphological engine AraMorph in order to optimize its morpho-syntactic analysis. Even if the engine has been optimized, a digital lexical source for better use of the system is still lacking. Part II presents a methodology exploiting the internal structure of the Arabic lexicographic encyclopaedia Lis\u0101n al-\u02bfarab, which allows automatic extraction of the roots and derived lemmas. The outcome of this work is a useful resource for morphological analysis of Arabic, either in its own right, or to enrich already existing resources.",
