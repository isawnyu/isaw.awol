    "description": "Le trait\u00e9 de Plotin Sur les trois substances qui sont des principes dans le corpus n\u00e9oplatonicien arabe. The paper examines the Arabic version of Plotinus\u2019 treatise \"On the Three Principal Hypostases\" (V 1[10]). First, a survey of the works that contain this version is presented: the \"pseudo-Theology\" of Aristotle and the \u201cSayings of the Greek Sage\u201d. Then, a passage is examined, which features in both works. It deals with the generation of Intellect from the One, describing the Intellect as the \u201cfirst image\u201d of the One. This topic features also in passages of the \"Theol. \" and the \u201cSayings\u201d that antecede the translation itself. This implies that the author of these passages was already acquainted with a Plotinian text that, in the flow of both works as they have come down to us, comes later. The author lays emphasis on the idea of Intellect as the \u201cfirst image\u201d of the One, transforming it into the topic of the immediate creation of Intellect, and of the creation of everything else through Intellect. This doctrine, that will be inspiring for Avicenna, lies at the core of the \"Liber de Causis\". Studia graeco-arabica 2 / 2012. In memoriam Alain-Philippe Segonds Il concetto di 'essere' dall\u2019Aristotele greco alla lingua araba. The problem of the translation into Arabic of the Greek philosophical terminology and in particular of the verb 'to be', and the reflection on the possible conditioning that every natural language can operate in a completely unconscious way in thinking and in the formulation of concepts was faced by Arabic-speaking philosophers well before by the modern linguists. By analyzing the Arabic direct and indirect tradition of \"Metaphysics Delta\" 7, in which Aristotle speaks of the different meanings of being, \u03c4\u1f78 \u1f44\u03bd, this study tries to test the awareness of these problems in the early translators of Greek philosophical and scientific heritage into Arabic language, such as the Christian Us\u1e6d\u0101\u1e6f, translator of the circle of al-Kind\u012b, and in the following generations of philosophers such as al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, Avicenna and Averroes.",
