    "description": "Part II. Lis\u0101n al-\u02bfarab as a source of lexical and morphological knowledge The following sections illustrate a part of the study on the morphology of the Arabic language which is carried on within the framework of the ERC project Greek into Arabic. Philosophical Concepts and Linguistic Bridges ADG 249431. We used the Arabic lexicographic encyclopaedia Lis\u0101n al-\u02bfarab and, thanks to the regularity of its structure, we developed a system for the extraction of morphologically labelled word sequences, to be exploited for morphological analysis purposes. Studia graeco-arabica 3 / 2013 Indexing techniques and variant readings management This paper illustrates indexing routines developed for the G2A Web Application, a philological system totally open source designed by the Team of the ILC-CNR of Pisa within the context of the ERC project Greek into Arabic. Philosophical Concepts and Linguistic Bridges (Ideas AdG 249431). Section 1 introduces the concept of \u2018index\u2019 in this peculiar field. The indexing process implemented by the ILC-CNR Team for the G2A Web Application is illustrated in Section 2. Section 3 discusses the component of textual criticism.",
