It will appear that Ya\u1e25y\u0101 ibn \u2018Ad\u012b\u2019s approach is based on F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s ideas about the relationship between logic and the sciences of language. Even more important is the fact that the difference established by Ya\u1e25y\u0101 ibn \u2018Ad\u012b\u2019s between logic and grammar both as for the subject (maw\u1e0d\u016b\u2018) and as for the scope (\u0121arad) counts as the source for Avicenna\u2019s distinction between subject (maw\u1e0d\u016b\u2018) and scope (\u0121arad) of the metaphysics.",
