    "description": "Trafficking Culture\u00a0aims to produce an evidence-based picture of the contemporary global trade in looted cultural objects.\u00a0This research programme is based at the University of Glasgow and is funded by the European Research Council.On this website, you can keep up to date with the research as it progresses. The Projects page outlines the research activities which make up the overall research programme, and links to summaries of work to be undertaken in each research strand. The\u00a0Encyclopedia\u00a0is a constantly evolving resource which presents introductory materials on the research topic. We encourage you to start here if you are looking for a short case study of a famously looted artefact, a critical analysis of a relevant law, a selection of methodological orientations for conducting research on the topic, or a brief introduction to criminological or social theory which may help us understand and engage with the issues. The Publications tab will take you to our research output past and present.We very much welcome communication from researchers and others interested in the topic, including prospective PhD students looking for supervision. For general communication please get in touch with us using the form on the Contact page, or if you want to contact a particular member of the research team you\u2019ll find individual email addresses listed on our People pages.
