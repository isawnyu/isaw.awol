    "description": "Biblicum Jassyense: Romanian Journal for Biblical Philology and Hermeneutics. ISSN: 2068-7664. \"Biblicum Jassyense\" is an annually peer reviewed international journal. Its aim is to reflect, from a neutral point of view, the philological debates that animate the domain of the Romanian and South-East European traditions of the Bible in the European context. We are also paying attention to the history of literarure and the history of religions, research that have as starting point the canonical or apocryphal religious texts from the proximity of the biblical tradition. In the studies, discussion notes and reviews sections we are hosting debates that approach such wider interest areas, but always have as starting point precise philological and hermeneutical applications. Volume 1 (2010).",
