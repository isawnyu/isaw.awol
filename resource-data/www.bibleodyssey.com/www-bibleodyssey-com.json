    "description": "Bible Odyssey. About the Society of Biblical Literature. Founded in 1880, the Society of Biblical Literature is the oldest and largest learned society devoted to the critical investigation of the Bible based on the Humanities\u2019 core disciplines. With over 8,000 members worldwide, it represents and convenes scholars whose life work is in biblical and ancient Near Eastern studies. The SBL promotes the academic study of the Bible and of sacred texts generally. Why Bible Odyssey Website?. The Bible is a revered text for many and holds an iconic status in American and even global culture. And yet, studies show that people are unfamiliar with its key themes or stories-and who can blame them? The Bible is not one book, but many: a compilation of poetry, law codes, novellas, proverbs, gospels, and letters that were pulled together over the centuries. Being literate about the Bible is a tall order-but an important one. Given the Bible\u2019s immense impact, our civic conversations and cultural awareness can only improve when we are able to recognize key people, places, and passages of the Bible. In addition, readers are also unfamiliar with critical approaches to the text. There is a big difference between Bible study, which happens in a religious setting, and study of the Bible, which happens in an academic one. Bible Odyssey addresses not only the literacy gap but also the gap between the academy and the \"street. \" Why should Bible scholars have all the fun? Wouldn\u2019t you like to know about the Synoptic Question, or about J, E, P, and D?.",
