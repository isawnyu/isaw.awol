    "description": "Internet Archaeology E-Monograph Series. Some Internet Archaeology articles are more like monographs. Unlike 'conventional' journal articles, they may contain 100s of images or link to or integrate large sets of data. All such articles already published in Internet Archaeology have been brought together in one place to form an E-Monograph series. This is not a separate digital publication (all remain listed as articles in their respective issues) but our aim is to showcase and highlight these particularly large bodies of work and to remind potential authors of the publishing opportunities available via Internet Archaeology. * = Open Access and freely available Monograph Number Author Title 1* David Dungworth Iron Age and Roman copper alloys from northern Britain 2* Christopher A.
