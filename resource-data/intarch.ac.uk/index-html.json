Internet Archaeology is the first fully refereed e-journal for archaeology and publishes articles of a high academic standing which utilise the potential of electronic publication. Internet Archaeology is hosted by the Department of Archaeology at the University of York and published by the Council for British Archaeology. Internet Archaeology is a hybrid Open Access e-journal. Internet Archaeology has been publishing on the web since 1996 and aims to provide new ways of presenting and engaging with archaeological research. International in scope and only available online, all journal content is subject to rigorous peer-review. Articles make use of the potential of the medium to present archaeological research, including video, audio, searchable data sets, full-colour images, visualisations, animations and interactive mapping.",
