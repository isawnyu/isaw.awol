    "description": "THE CATALOGUSThe Catalogus Philologorum Classicorum (CPhCl) provides a reference tool for all those who study greek and latin antiquity, specifically useful for studies on the history of classical scholarship in the modern age. It is an encyclopaedic lexicon collecting the bio-bibliographical data about classical philologists and it is a continuation and improvement of W. P\u00f6kel\u2019s Philologisches Schriftstellerlexikon, Leipzig 1882. Only deceased scholars are included.THE HISTORY OF THE CATALOGUSThe Catalogus started off with the 1984 CNR international conference \"La filologia classica nel secolo XX\" (strongly supported by Scevola Mariotti) and with its proceedings, published in Pisa in 1989. Subsequently the preparation of a Catalogus Philologorum Classicorum has begun at the Dipartimento di Filologia Classica of the University of Pisa, with the financial support of CNR, and has been on-line since 2003, within the web-site Aristarchus, thanks to a cooperation between the Dipartimento di Filologia Classica of the University of Pisa and the Dipartimento di Archeologia e Filologia Classica (D.AR.FI.CL.ET.) of the University of Genoa.THE CATALOGUS TODAYThe CPhCl has become an international network since 2009. The central unit, which has its head office at the Dipartimento di Archeologia e Filologia Classica of the University of Genoa, is responsible for the coordination and supervision of the whole project, as well as the administration of the website. The cards concerning the scholars have been attributed to the local units according to geographic and linguistic criteria. A three-letter abbreviation identifies the country of the unit which is responsible for each card.Home Page [A]Database [B]Bibliography [C]Links [D]E-mail [S] Aristarchus [T] Registration form [E] Web accessibility [F] Italian intro [Z] Cards status Total: 8762Available: 889 Programmed: 7873 [As of : 25-05-201]",
