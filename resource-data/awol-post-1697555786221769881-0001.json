The journal contains preliminary reports of excavations and surveys in Israel, as well as final reports of small-scale excavations and surveys; it also publishes archaeological finds recorded during inspection activities. The journal is bilingual, Hebrew and English; reports submitted in English are translated into Hebrew and vice versa.\u00a0The e-journal www.hadashot-esi.org.il is the digital format of HA-ESI, replacing the printed version. The first digital publication of the journal\u00a0(No. 116, 2004)\u00a0is\u00a0a reflection of\u00a0the last printed volume.\u00a0From 2005 onward, the journal will be published on-line only \u2013 each year will receive a volume number, continuing the numbering of the printed journal (e.g., No. 117 = 2005,\u00a0No. 118\u00a0= 2006, etc.).\u00a0The e-journal is an unlimited data base of archeological reports, including photographs, maps, plans and pottery figures. The reports can be searched by keywords or by means of an interactive map. The results of both types of searches can be printed. \u00a0The reports submitted to the e-journal will be edited in the same manner as in the printed journal (see Guide to Contributors). They will be published on-line with the completion of their editing and translation, and will be ascribed to a specific issue according to the year of publication (issue no. = year of publication). A final excavation report is marked with as asterix*. Announcements of new publications will appear on the Home Page of the e-journal.
