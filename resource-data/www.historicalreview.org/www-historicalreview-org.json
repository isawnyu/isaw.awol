    "description": "[First posted in AWOL 29 October 2009, update 5 March 2014]. The Historical Review/La Revue Historique. eISSN:1791-7603. ISSN:1790-3572. The Historical Revue / La Revue Historique is an annual refereed journal of historical research in the human sciences published by the Department of Neohellenic Research (DNR) of the National Hellenic Research Foundation (NHRF) since 2004. It was established as a medium of communication and exchange of ideas with colleagues around the world. We invite original papers and critical perspectives from a wide range of fields within Modern Greek studies, but are not limited to it. Our intention is to provide a medium of dialogue and reflection in the broad field of historical study in the human sciences. In the effort to intensify scholarly dialogue the INR has decided to take advantage of electronic publishing to provide open access to the full content of the journal. A fully electronic publication management system ensures a speedy process, and offers authors the ability to follow the progress of their manuscripts through the publication process. Revised manuscripts of accepted articles are published immediately upon submission of the final version. Each volume comprises the total of the articles published during the year. The print edition appears at the end of every year. The National Documentation Centre of Greece (EKT), also part of the NHRF, provides publication management and technical support for the electronic publication of The Historical Revue / La Revue Historique.",
