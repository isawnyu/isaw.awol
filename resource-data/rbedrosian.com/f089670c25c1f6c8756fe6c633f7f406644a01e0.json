    "description": "Lettre du patriarche Jacobite Jean X (1064-73) au catholique Arm\u00e9nien Gregoire II., in 55 pdf pages. This study by the noted Orientalist Fran\u00e7ois Nau appeared in Revue de l'Orient Chr\u00e9tien 7(1912) pp. 145-198. It is the Syriac text and French translation of a letter to an unnamed Armenian kat'oghikos \u2014probably Grigor II Vkayaser (Martyrophile, 1066-1105)\u2014by the Monophysite Syrian patriarch John Bar Shushan (1064-1073). The first part is a statement of Jacobite beliefs, while the second is a criticism of the Armenian Monophysites for permitting certain worldly customs and practises.
