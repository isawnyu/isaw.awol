    "description": "Bar'aran surb grots' handerdz patkerok' [Illustrated Dictionary of the Bible] (Constantinople, 1881). An extensive and remarkably fine Bible dictionary in Armenian, with tables, maps and illustrations. This anonymous work in 707 pdf pages is more thorough than and, we believe, superior to the famous English-language Dictionary of the Bible (1888) by Dr. William Smith. File size: 31.4 MB. Hamabarbar' kam ts'ank nmanadzayn bar'its' noroy ktakarani [Concordance or Listing of Homophonous Words in the New Testament]",
