    "description": "The Council of University Classical Departments is the professional forum for all teachers of classical Greek and Roman subjects in British Universities. It has four meetings annually: three meetings of the Standing Committee, and a plenary Council meeting in November, at which all UK Classics Departments (and remnants thereof) are represented (see the constitution, and \"Contacts, Representatives, and Member Institutions\" below). As well as serving as a voice for classical teachers in higher education on matters of academic and professional significance, CUCD collects annual statistics on students numbers in UK classical degree programmes, and publishes the CUCD Bulletin, which is available on-line from volume 24 (1995), and continues to appear in hard copy at the time of the annual Council meeting.Bulletin 41 (2012)Bulletin 40 (2011)Bulletin 39 (2010)Bulletin 38 (2009)Bulletin 37 (2008)Bulletin 36 (2007)Bulletin 35 (2006)Bulletin 34 (2005)Bulletin 33 (2004)Bulletin 32 (2003)Bulletin 31 (2002)Bulletin 30 (2001)Bulletin 29 (2000)Bulletin 28 (1999)Bulletin 27 (1998)Bulletin 26 (1997)Bulletin 25 (1996)Bulletin 24 (1995)",
