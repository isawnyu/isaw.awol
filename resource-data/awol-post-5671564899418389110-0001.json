    "description": "The information presented on these indexed pages has been summarized from the superb reference work The Roman Inscriptions of Britain - Vol.I Inscriptions on Stone by Prof. R.G. Collingwood and R.P. Wright (Oxford 1965).In the RBO version the following information is presented; the R.I.B. designation number and observed Latin text, the nature and condition of medium, the date and place of its discovery, its current whereabouts - whether in a museum, private collection, still in situ, lost, destroyed, etc. - the date of the inscription, where it may be ascertained, also whether the text has been restored. In addition, all of the place-name headings on the linked pages are clickable, and lead to separate pages on each location where many of the inscriptions have been translated. All translations are, however, the work of the RBO WebMaster, Togodumnus, upon whom all blame should be laid for any inherent mistakes.",
