    "description": "Archaeology International, produced annually, combines news about UCL Institute of Archaeology activities with reports on research, both on new and on-going projects, carried out by members of staff. Papers reflect the broad geographical, theoretical and methodological scope of research at the Institute, including those of its three main Sections (World Archaeology, Archaeological Sciences and Heritage Studies), and its extensive global fieldwork presence. The journal has been relaunched with a double issue in 2011 to mark the Institute of Archaeology\u2019s coming 75th anniversary year, and is now also online and fully open access.",
