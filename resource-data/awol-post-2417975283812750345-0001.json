    "description": "Our journal is dedicated to public education about the history and cultures of Eurasia, especially in pre-modern times. While we invoke the historic \"Silk Road\" in our title, our view of the Silk Roads is an expansive one, encompassing pre-history, the era beginning with the establishment of trans-Eurasian trade and cultural interaction some two millennia ago, and the subsequent history of those interactions down through the centuries. Modern evocations of cultural traditions are of interest, especially in the areas which historically have been the domain of pastoral nomads. We publish articles by well known scholars and those who have other expertise on the regions and material of interest. Where possible we are communicating the results of the latest research, including new archaeological investigations. The journal also serves as the means to alert readers about upcoming programs connected with Silk Road topics.Current Issue!Volume 11 2013Volume 10 2012Volume 9 2011Volume 8 2010Volume 7 Autumn 2009Volume 6 Number 2 Winter/Spring 2009Volume 6 Number 1 Summer 2008Volume 5 Number 2 Winter 2008Volume 5 Number 1 Summer 2007Volume 4 Number 2 Winter 2006 - 2007Volume 4 Number 1 Summer 2006Volume 3 Number 2 December 2005Volume 3 Number 1 June 2005",
