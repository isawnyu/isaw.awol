    "description": "[First posted in AWL 1 March 2010. Updated 11 November 2013] Horizon: The Amarna Project and Amarna Trust Newsletter The ancient Egyptian city of Tell el-Amarna (or simply Amarna) was the short-lived capital built by the \u2018heretic\u2019 Pharaoh Akhenaten and abandoned shortly after his death (c. 1332 BCE). It was here that he pursued his vision of a society dedicated to the cult of one god, the power of the sun (the Aten). As well as this historic interest Amarna remains the largest readily accessible living-site from ancient Egypt. It is thus simultaneously the key to a chapter in the history of religious experience and to a fuller understanding of what it was like to be an ancient Egyptian. There is no other site like it.
