    "description": "The Christianization of the Peloponnese. <blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">The aim of this project is to advance an understanding of the changing processes involved in the Christianization of the Peloponnese with particular reference to the location and socio-political context of churches from the 5th to 7th centuries CE. An intensive topographic and archaeological study has made it possible to present a detailed image database of the Late Antique Churches of the Peloponnese and a clickable map based on GPS data. The results of the analysis of this work, which will be published shortly in three articles, have shown clearly the evidence for phased and largely peaceful Christianization of the Peloponnese with a considered use of memory and tradition at different times, rather than that of a violent transition, as is frequently portrayed in the historical literature. <ul><li> <a href=\"http://arts. st-andrews. ac. uk/greekbasilicas/index. php\">Home</a> </li><li> <a href=\"http://arts. st-andrews. ac. uk/greekbasilicas/methodology. php\">Methodology</a> </li><li> <a href=\"http://arts. st-andrews. ac. uk/greekbasilicas/sites. php\">The sites</a> </li><li> <a href=\"http://arts. st-andrews. ac. uk/greekbasilicas/results. php\">Results</a> </li><li> <a href=\"http://arts. st-andrews. ac. uk/greekbasilicas/bibliography. php\">Bibliography</a> </li><li> <a href=\"http://arts. st-andrews. ac. uk/greekbasilicas/acknowledgements. php\">Acknowledgements</a> </li></ul></blockquote> Home Methodology The sites Results Bibliography Acknowledgements.",
