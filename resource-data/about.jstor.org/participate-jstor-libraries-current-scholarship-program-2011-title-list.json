    "description": "Current Scholarship Program. The Current Scholarship Program (CSP) makes current and historical scholarly content available on a single, integrated platform, providing a single point for librarians and end users around the world to access this content, and ensuring this content's long-term preservation. Faculty and students around the world will be able to access all licensed content on JSTOR - current issues, back issues, and a growing set of primary source materials from libraries - easily and seamlessly. For the 2011 subscription year, 174 titles from 19 publishers are available via the Current Scholarship Program. Libraries may subscribe to current issues on a Single Title basis or assemble their own custom collections of single titles. For both Single Title and Collections, JSTOR provides current issue access back to the Digital Availability Date for each title. This date is defined as either: (a) the first online volume published that was also available for purchase by libraries from the publisher (e. g. not an aggregator), or (b) for titles not yet online, the year ahead of the moving wall. This date is fixed so a current subscription grows in content year after year for all subscribers. In addition to current issues, libraries may subscribe to full runs of Single Titles (from Volume 1, Issue 1 to present) and Collections. Titles in the 2011 JSTOR Current Scholarship Program release relating to the Ancient World include:.",
