    "description": "Friends of Archaeology (FA). The Friends of Archaeology provides a biannual FA newsletter and two events for members each year, and organizes other events such as an annual symposium and public lectures. The ANL began life in 1956 as a leisurely letter from the trenches of the Jerusalem Project to ROM members back in Canada. The late Dr. Douglas A. Tushingham thought that members might like to be kept informed about the latest research ROM archaeologists were doing in the field. The ANL proved to be very popular as members felt connected to their Museum and its research in a tangible way. Topic areas have included interim reports on long-term excavation and survey projects, blood residue, petrographic, and use-wear analyses, detecting ceramic fakes, underwater archaeology, public archaeology, epigraphic recording, the early use of archaeological databases, and rock art research among many others. Articles have centred on research in areas as diverse as China, Ontario, Egypt and Sudan, Yemen, Belize, and Peru among others. We are pleased to offer past Archaeological Newsletters (ANL) online.",
