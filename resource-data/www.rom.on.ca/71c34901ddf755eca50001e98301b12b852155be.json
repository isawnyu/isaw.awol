The Royal Ontario Museum is no longer producing the Archaeological Newsletter (ANL). The final issue was Series IV, No. 6, December 2009. We have created a ROM membership-based group entitled Friends of Archaeology (FA). The Friends of Archaeology provides a biannual FA newsletter and two events for members each year, and organizes other events such as an annual symposium and public lectures.",
