    "description": "Articles by the Black Sea Centre Other Resources:. The Centre aims to construct a gazetteer with information on all relevant ancient sites in the Black Sea region, which may serve as a common source to all researchers in the zone. The Centre continuously adds information to the data base. The main focus lies on references in literary sources, coinage, site photos, bibliographies, and to some extent GPS-pos. The Centre has, in collaboration with The Royal Collection of Coins and Medals in Copenhagen, created an electronic inventory of all the coins from the Black Sea area in Danish collections with high quality images which can be searched through the internet. In 2005 Niels Chr. Nielsen from University of Southern Denmark created a digital terrain model of the entire Black Sea area based on data made available by the American National Geospatial Intelligence Agency. The cell size in the model is 50 m. On the basis of this, contours with equidistance of 25 meters have been extracted",
