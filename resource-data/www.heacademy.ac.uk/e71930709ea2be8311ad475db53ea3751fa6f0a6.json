Research in Archaeological Education is an international, peer-reviewed on-line journal devoted to research of archaeological education. The journal defines such research in the broadest possible way, to encompass all pedagogical scholarship in archaeology. It therefore makes a strong commitment to raising the profile of research into archaeological pedagogies, and in so doing provides a forum for active, scholarly critique and review that transcends national borders.",
