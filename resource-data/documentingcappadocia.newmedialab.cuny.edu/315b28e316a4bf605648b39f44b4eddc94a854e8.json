    "description": "Documenting Cappadocia. New Website Content By A. L. McMichael on January 20, 2015 In the spirit of a new year (and a semester break), this site has lots of new content. Note the new Essays section with brief encyclopedia-style entries on topics related to Cappadocian art and architecture. The Architecture section now includes gallery posts with photos of Cappadocian monuments. These posts indicate alternate names and translations of the monuments as well as their location (by valley or town). Additional galleries will be rolled out gradually over the next few weeks. You may also notice updates to the Share and About pages (including rights information), and a \u201cSuggested citation for this page\u201d notice at the end of research-based posts.",
