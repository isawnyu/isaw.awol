    "description": "[First posted in AWOL 25 February 2010, updated 7 May 2015]. Gouden hoorn: tijdschrift over Byzantium = Golden horn: journal of Byzantium. ISSN: 0929-7820. This is the archive of Gouden Hoorn (Golden Horn), Journal of Byzantium, which was published by Godiva \u00c9ditions on the initiative of the Council of Independent Byzantinists (Onafhankelijk Byzantinologen Overleg, OBO), that was founded on 29th November, 1991. The OBO aims at informing and bringing together lovers of Byzantium. The OBO hoped to reach its goal by publishing Gouden Hoorn twice a year. Gouden Hoorn was published in a paper version as well as on this website. We no longer publish the paper version, and since 2002 we have not published any new issue (9:1 was the last issue). Gouden Hoorn was edited by Annabelle Parker and Andr\u00e9 de Raaij. Jan Pieter Kunst was webmaster of the old Gouden Hoorn site that was hosted on Isidore-website. Copyright of the articles is with each author. Articles can be reproduced only after consulting the editors and not without mentioning the source. The editors have aimed at settling copyright according to statutory regulation. Those who nevertheless think they are entitled to certain rights, can apply to the editors. Gouden Hoorn can be contacted via P. O. Box 10730, 1001 ES Amsterdam, The Netherlands, or via our e-mail-address: Gouden Hoorn (printed edition) = ISSN 0929-7820.",
