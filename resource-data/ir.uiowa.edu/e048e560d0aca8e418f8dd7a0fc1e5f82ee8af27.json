Mathal/Mashal: Journal of Islamic and Judaic Multidisciplinary Studies\u00a0 (ISSN forthcoming) is a peer-reviewed, open access journal dedicated to\u00a0 scholarly discussion of topics present in the Islamic and Jewish\u00a0 traditions, cultures, and practices especially in the area where\u00a0 thematic and doctrinal aspects are common. The journal approaches these complex issues\u00a0 through interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary lenses. There are many\u00a0 topics that lend themselves to comparative studies but we will publish\u00a0 papers that deal with any of the topics in either of the traditions. Topics that can be discussed include Islamic and Jewish law,\u00a0 socio-economic and political history of the Islamic and Jewish\u00a0 communities, social and religious institutions, Tafsir and Rabbinic\u00a0 traditions, Midrash and/or Islamic and Jewish mysticism.",
