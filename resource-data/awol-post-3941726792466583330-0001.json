    "description": "Many of you are familiar with the Bible Study Textbook Series (The Old Green Commentaries).\u00a0 These were very popular several years back and many of you have requested copies of these timeless treasures.\u00a0 Because reprint cost are so high we have chosen not to reprint but instead, we are offering them electronically for free. These commentaries are being made available for your personal use. Feel free to download them\u00a0to your computer.\u00a0 These files are very large and may take a while even with high speed and DSL services. If using dial up service please be aware the your download times may be extensive and you may encounter problems during the download. If you have problems downloading these files you want to consider using a download manager. Thank you\u00a0for your interest in College Press.",
