    "description": "[First posted in AWOL. 6 November 2009. Updated 21 October 2014]. Rasenna: Journal of the Center for Etruscan Studies. ISSN: 1940-073X. The electronic journal Rasenna: Journal of the Center for Etruscan Studies is published under the auspices of the Classics Department and the Center for Etruscan Studies at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The journal is an integral part of the Center\u2019s mission to advance and promote research on the Etruscans and their civilization within the academic arena as well as to the general public. Print publications devoted to research on the Etruscans are rare. Reliable electronic resources of a scholarly nature are virtually non-existent. The journal Rasenna provides free access to cutting-edge, peer-reviewed articles that address topics across a range of interdisciplinary perspectives. The journal also publishes substantive reviews of the latest books in the field and encourages scholarly responses to published articles. The electronic medium affords publication opportunities that cannot be matched by print journals due to cost and formatting constraints. It permits the publication of full-color images, video segments, and audio clips. Links to other sites can be embedded in the text. The Etruscans left behind a wealth of artifacts and epigraphic documents, images of which can be presented effectively in an electronic format. The electronic medium also permits more timely publication of research and reviews. By publishing electronically the amount of time elapsing between the submission of an article and its appearance in a print can be halved thus permitting more efficient transmission of scholarly ideas. Finally, given the rising cost of print productions and decreases in funding for library resources, an electronic publication ensures that the international community of scholars has free and unlimited access to the latest research in the field.
