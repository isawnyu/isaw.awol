The magazine as. is published quarterly in three languages and provides information about the latest discoveries, research results, exhibitions, experimental archaeology and much more and is written in a style that is easily understood by laypeople. Each issue is dedicated to a different core theme. There is a special edition on a region or a topic every year. The journal is the official newsletter of the Swiss Archaeological Society (formerly: the Society for Pre- and Protohistory, SGUF), which has been published since 1937 under the titles \"Ur-Schweiz\" (Prehistoric Switzerland), \"Helvetia Archaeologica\" and \"Mitteilungsblatt SGUF\" (SGUF Newsletter). After the Helvetia Archaeologica split off in 1976 to become an independent journal, the \"Mitteilungsblatt SGUF\" first appeared in its present-day form under the name \"Arch\u00e4ologie der Schweiz\" (Archaeology of Switzerland). \"Arch\u00e4ologie Schweiz\" (Archaeology Switzerland) (until 2005: \"Schweizerische Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Ur- und Fr\u00fchgeschichte\" - Swiss Society for Pre - and Protohistory), founded in 1907, is a society with members in every linguistic region in Switzerland. A good half are amateurs with an interest in archaeology, the rest are experts, students and other interested bodies. Today, Archaeology Switzerland concentrates on two areas: firstly, communicating results to all interested parties, and secondly, carrying out archaeological projects involving multiple Swiss cantons.",
