    "description": "Inventory of Byzantine Churches on Cyprus. This collection of data was originally intended to serve as a tool and support for the author\u2019s doctoral dissertation, dealing with the architecture of these buildings and its possible interpretations in the context of the island\u2019s economy, demography and culture [Papacostas (1999a)]; but it is being made available online as an inventory to facilitate further research on the monuments. New discoveries constantly add to the corpus of relevant monuments, as does further study of the architecture and fresco decoration of structures hitherto ascribed to or appearing at first sight to date from later centuries. While this collection, therefore, is neither comprehensive, nor complete, largely representing the state of scholarship at the turn of the millennium, we hope that it can be of use to colleagues. In particular, we would encourage the use of the urls provided here to accompany relevant materials, particularly images, that they may be publishing online. We are extremely grateful to the A. G. Leventis Foundation, whose generous support has made this publication possible. How to cite.
