    "description": "The Egypt Exploration Society YouTube Channel. The EES has been working in Egypt since 1882. Our aim is to make all aspects of the culture of ancient and historic Egypt (to 1900 AD) better known to the public. Our fieldwork and research is undertaken in Egypt itself and the results of this work are made available through our website (ees. ac. uk), our publications, and through events held in London and Cairo. The Society is a registered UK charity and relies on subscriptions and donations to fund its work. Membership is open to anyone with an interest in ancient Egypt.",
