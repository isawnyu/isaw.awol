These are presented at Conferences and Workshops, Public lectures, Upper House Seminars, BSA Seminars in collaboration with other Institutions, Fitch-Wiener Seminars in Archaeological Science, BSA Friends Lectures. They are held in Greece or the UK. Since 2011 a select number of these have been made available to a wider audience through video or audio recordings archived on the School\u2019s website. There are also links to a number of Video tours and montages highlighting aspects of the School\u2019s work.",
