    "description": "Remote Sensing & Photogrammetry Society Archaeology Special Interest Group Newsletter. The Archaeology SIG aims to encourage the exchange of research and methodology between remote sensing scientists and archaeologists, especially those concerned with methods of site prospection and novel applications. Meetings concentrate on a mixture of case studies and developing methodology and include ground-based methods, photogrammetry, LIDAR, laser scanning, and geophysical prospection, as well as aerial photography and thermal imaging. SIG Activities The Archaeology Special Interest Group of the Remote Sensing and Photogrammetry Society aims to: Promote the development & use of remote sensing in archaeological surveying Encourage research in all aspects of remote site location and interpretation Provide a forum for the exchange of information & ideas Current areas of interest include the following: Satellite data interpretation Aerial photographic analysis Digital image processing Ground-based applications High-resolution photographic techniques Radar Thermal line scanning GIS UAV s.",
