    "description": "We are happy to release the first-ever bulletin of online emendations made to papyri in the Duke Databank of Documentary Papyri (DDbDP). As is well known, papyrologists around the world have over the past two years been entering published documentary texts to the Duke Databank via the Papyrological Editor (formerly SoSOL) at www.papyri.info/editor/. In the process, some people have also proposed a number of emendations to existing texts. This bulletin gathers the proposals that have so far been vetted and adopted by the PN's editorial board. Our hope is that by issuing regular updates we will provide users with a helpful overview of evolving scholarly discussion concerning individual texts. We believe that these bulletins will also facilitate ongoing production of resources such as the Berichtigungsliste and HGV by highlighting meaningful changes to texts among the many other kinds of alterations (automated fixes, typo corrections, etc.) that are regularly made to documents in the DDbDP.
