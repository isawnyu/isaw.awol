    "description": "Oxbow Books Notes: Nimrud (ancient Kalhu) in northern Iraq, was the capital of the Assyrian Empire during most of the 9th and 8th centuries BC, and remained a major centre until the destruction of the Empire in 612 BC. This authoritative account, written by two of the excavators of the site, traces its history and its gradual revelation through archaeological excavation, begun by Layard in the 19th century and continuing to the present day. The volume is abundantly illustrated and includes finds that have not previously been published, together with illustrations and the most complete account in English so far of the remarkable discoveries made in recent years by Iraqi archaeologists in the tombs of the Assyrian Queens. Contents: Introduction;Chapter 1: The Land of Assyria - Setting the Scene;Chapter 2: Major Palaces on the Citadel;Chapter 3: Tombs, Wells and Riches;Chapter 4: Temples, Minor Palaces and Private Houses;Chapter 5: Fort Shalmaneser: the ekal masarti;Chapter 6: The Written Evidence;Chapter 7: Types of Object and Materials from Nimrud;Chapter 8: Post-Assyrian Nimrud;Epilogue.",
