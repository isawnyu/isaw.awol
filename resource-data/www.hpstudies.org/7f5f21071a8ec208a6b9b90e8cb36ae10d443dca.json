    "description": "[First posted in AWOL 30 September 2009. Updated 16 March 2014]. Hebraic Political Studies. ISSN: 1565-6640. Hebraic Political Studies is an international, peer-reviewed journal launched in 2005. The journal is published quarterly by Shalem Press, and edited by Professor Gordon Schochet of Rutgers University and Dr. Arthur Eyffinger of the Huygens Institute in the Netherlands. Hebraic Political Studies publishes articles that explore the political concepts of the Hebrew Bible and rabbinic literature, the significance of reflections on the Hebrew Bible and Judaic sources in the history of ideas, and the role of these sources in the history of the West. Hebraic Political Studies aims to evaluate the place of the Jewish textual tradition, alongside the traditions of Greece and Rome, in political history and the history of political thought.",
