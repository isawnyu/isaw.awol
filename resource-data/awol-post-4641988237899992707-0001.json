    "description": "Newsletters Documenting the Progress of Cultural Revitalisation Projects in Kabul and HeratThese newsletters document the progress of the revitalisation projects of the Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC), which began the rehabilitation of Bagh-e-Babur, a walled and terraced garden containing the tomb of Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire, in 2002. The programme has expanded to include the 19th-century mausoleum in central Kabul over the grave of Timur Shah and a great number of homes, mosques and other structures in the war-damaged quarters of Asheqan wa Arefan, Chindawol and Kuche Kharabat. In Herat, in western Afghanistan, a range of documentation, conservation and upgrading works has also been carried out since 2005 in surviving historic sections of the old city.October 2011 Afghanistan NewsletterSize: 528 KBMay 2011 Afghanistan NewsletterSize: 368 KBNovember / December 2010 Afghanistan NewsletterSize: 519 KBJuly / August 2010 Afghanistan NewsletterSize: 531 KBJuly / August 2010 Afghanistan NewsletterSize: 573 KBMay / June 2010 Afghanistan NewsletterSize: 499 KBMarch / April 2010 Afghanistan NewsletterSize: 502 KBJanuary / February 2010 Afghanistan NewsletterSize: 511 KBNovember / December 2009 Afghanistan NewsletterSize: 437 KBSeptember / October 2009 Afghanistan NewsletterSize: 452 KBMay / June 2009 Afghanistan NewsletterSize: 616 KBMarch / April 2009 Afghanistan NewsletterSize: 728 KBJanuary / February 2009 Afghanistan NewsletterSize: 519 KBNovember / December 2008 Afghanistan NewsletterSize: 610 KBSeptember / October 2008 Afghanistan NewsletterSize: 611 KBJuly / August 2008 Afghanistan NewsletterSize: 463 KBMay / June 2008 Afghanistan NewsletterSize: 663 KBMay / June 2008 Afghanistan NewsletterSize: 663 KBMarch / April 2008 Afghanistan NewsletterSize: 622 KBNovember 2007 Afghanistan NewsletterSize: 739 KBSeptember/October 2007 Afghanistan NewsletterSize: 568 KBJuly 2007 Afghanistan NewsletterSize: 749 KBMay 2007 Afghanistan NewsletterSize: 672 KBMarch 2007 Afghanistan NewsletterSize: 569 KBJanuary 2007 Afghanistan NewsletterSize: 348 KBNovember / December 2006 Afghanistan NewsletterSize: 573 KBSeptember / October 2006 Afghanistan NewsletterSize: 496 KBSeptember / October 2006 Afghanistan NewsletterSize: 496 KBAugust 2006 Afghanistan NewsletterSize: 435 KBJuly 2006 Afghanistan NewsletterSize: 337 KBProject Brief on AfghanistanSize: 593 KBJanuary / February 2008 Afghanistan NewsletterSize: 471 KBUrban Conservation and Area Development in AfghanistanSize: 6 MBAugust 2006 Afghanistan NewsletterSize: 435 KBBarbur's Garden Rehabilitation FrameworkSize: 5.97 MB",
