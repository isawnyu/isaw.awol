    "description": "Nag Hammadi Archive The Nag Hammadi codices, thirteen ancient manuscripts containing over fifty religious and philosophical texts written in Coptic and hidden in an earthenware jar for 1,600 years, were accidentally discovered in upper Egypt in the year 1945. This immensely important discovery included a large number of primary Gnostic scriptures. These texts were once thought to have been entirely destroyed during the early Christian struggle to define \"orthodoxy,\" scriptures such as the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Philip, and the Gospel of Truth. The images in this collection were taken during the excavations and translation project of the 1970\u2019s and record the environments surrounding excavations, visiting dignitaries, and the scholars working on the codices. The project has provided momentum to a major reassessment of early Christian history and the nature of Gnosticism. Sacred Text Conference Archives The First Annual Conference of Religions is a conversation and exploration of passages addressing relationships with insiders and outsiders, and points of inclusivity and exclusivity, within the Sacred Texts of six groups: Islam, Judaism, Christianity, Zoroastrianism, LDS/Mormonism, and Hinduism.",
