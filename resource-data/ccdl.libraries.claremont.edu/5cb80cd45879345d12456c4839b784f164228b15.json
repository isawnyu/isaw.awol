    "description": "Bulletin of the Institute for Antiquity and Christianity The Institute for Antiquity and Christianity is a center for basic research on the origins and meaning of the cultural heritage of Western civilization. The Bulletin of the Institute for Antiquity and Christianity is published periodically under the auspices of the Society for Antiquity and Christianity for the general information of persons interested in the research programs of the Institute. Campi Phlegraei, Observations on the Volcanoes of the Two Sicilies The two volumes of the Campi Phlegraei (1776) and the Supplement to the Campi Phlegraei (1779) provide a firsthand report from Sir William Hamilton which documents the late eighteenth century eruptions of Mount Vesuvius and are important to the science of volcanology due to the precise descriptions of the changes in the appearance of the volcano, the lava flows and other volcanic activity. Displayed here in their entirety, these books contain text in both English and French and 59 hand-colored plates with accompanying explanations.",
