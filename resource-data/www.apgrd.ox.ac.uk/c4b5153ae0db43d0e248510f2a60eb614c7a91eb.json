Ancient drama has exerted a uniquely formative influence on cultural and intellectual life since the Renaissance, and today ancient plays are being performed in both the commercial and amateur theatre with greater frequency than at any time since antiquity. The Archive of Performances of Greek and Roman Drama was founded in 1996 by Edith Hall and Oliver Taplin in response to the need for a coordinated research effort devoted to the international production and reception of ancient plays since the Renaissance. They included within its scope revivals and adaptations on stage, film and radio, and in opera and dance.",
