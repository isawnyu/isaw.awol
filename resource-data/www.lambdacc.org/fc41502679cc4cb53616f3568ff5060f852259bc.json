    "description": "Iris:\u00a0 The Newsletter of the Lambda Classical Caucus. <blockquote>The Lambda Classical Caucus is a coalition of queer Classicists-including, but not limited to, lesbians, bisexuals, gay men, and transgendered people-and their friends and supporters. It was founded in 1989 as the Lesbian and Gay Classical Caucus. Although Lambda is a group affiliated with the American Philological Association, LCC members need not belong to the APA. Anyone who wishes to participate, and who is sympathetic to our mission, is welcome to <a href=\"http://www. lambdacc. org/membership. html\">join the LCC</a>. The purpose of the Caucus is twofold: scholarly and political. Our scholarly purpose is to promote research that reflects the personal and intellectual interests of queer scholars, and provide a bridge between Classics and the interdisciplinary fields of LGBT/Queer Studies, the history of sexuality, cultural studies, and gender theory. Our main activities are hosting <a href=\"http://www. lambdacc. org/panels/index. html\">academic panels</a> and co-hosting the opening-night reception at the annual APA meeting. We also sponsor an <a href=\"http://www. lambdacc. org/list. html\">email discussion list</a> and the annual <a href=\"http://www. lambdacc. org/awards/rehak. html\">Rehak Award</a> and also a new <a href=\"http://www. lambdacc. org/awards/graduate. html\">Graduate Student Paper Award</a>. </blockquote> join the LCC <blockquote>The Lambda Classical Caucus is a coalition of queer Classicists-including, but not limited to, lesbians, bisexuals, gay men, and transgendered people-and their friends and supporters.
