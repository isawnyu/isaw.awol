    "description": "Popular Archaeology magazine is a 100% online periodical dedicated to bringing archaeology to the public. We bring high quality original content, much of it produced exclusively for Popular Archaeology, for discriminating readers of the general public who have come to expect content similar to what can be found in the major print magazines. Unlike most other major magazines related to archaeology, no paper copies will ever be produced and distributed, so it will always be \"green\", and it will always be less costly to produce and therefore far less costly to purchase by premium subscribers (although regular subscriptions are always free). Most of our writers and contributors are either professionals or top experts in their fields, or are individuals relating first-hand experiences; however, the magazine is unique among other archaeology-related magazines in that it makes it easy to invite and encourage members of the public (YOU) to submit pertinent articles, blogs, events, directory listings, and classified ads for publication. As a volunteer or student, do you have a fascinating story to tell about an archaeological experience? As a professional archaeologist, scholar, educator, or scientist, do you have a discovery, program or project that you think would be of interest to the world? Do you have an archaeology-related service or item for sale? Would you like to have your archaeology-related blog post featured on the front page? ( Ad and specially featured item prices are lower than what you will find in any other major archaeology magazine). Through Popular Archaeology, you can realize all of these things. Moreover, because the content is produced by a very broad spectrum of contributors, you will see more feature articles than what you would typically find in the major print publications, with the same content quality. As a community of professionals, writers, students, and volunteers, we invite you to join us as subscribers in this adventure of archaeological discovery. It could open up a whole new world for you. Basic access to this magazine by the public will always be free. Many of the articles are only available to regular (free) subscribers, and some of them, our highest quality original content, are only available in full to premium (paying) subscribers.",
