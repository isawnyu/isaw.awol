Updated (corrected links) 26 January 2013] Guidebooks Available for Three Historic Syrian Citadels ArchNet, an international online community for architects, planners, urban designers, landscape architects, conservationists, and scholars, with a focus on Muslim cultures and civilisations has announced: Revitilisation projects are currently underway in Syria at Masyaf Citadel, the Castle of Salah ad-Din, and Aleppo Citadel through the efforts of the Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC). Guidebooks providing visual and textual documentation for each of these prominent architectural sites are now available on ArchNet. Published by the AKTC, the three guidebooks are all 45-50 pages long and include a description, history, site plan and visitor tour. Each is helpfully illustrated with rich color photographs, drawings and maps depicting the site and its place in the region. Elevation, section, and axonometric views are also included, providing a heightened sense of the architecture of these historic citadels.",
