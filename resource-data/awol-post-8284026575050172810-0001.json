    "description": "The Coroplastic Studies Interest Group (CSIG) was organized in 2007 under the auspices of the Archaeological Institute of America (AIA). It is one of the 13 Interest Groups of the AIA that normally comprise AIA members. Although membership in the AIA is not a prerequisite for membership in the CSIG, CSIG members are encouraged to join the AIA. The CSIG takes its name from the ancient Greek word koroplast, which in Greek antiquity was the term used for a modeler of images in clay.",
