    "description": "Social Science Research Network, Classics Research Network SSRN (the Social Science Research Network) was formally incorporated 17 years ago in October, 1994. It originated in 1992 as FEN (Financial Economics Network), the brainchild of Wayne Marr. Our vision was (and still is) to enable scholars to share and distribute their research worldwide, long before their papers work their way through the multi-year journal refereeing and publication process. We vowed to do so at the lowest cost possible for authors and readers. Since 1992 over 179,000 authors have uploaded more than 381,000 papers and abstracts to SSRN's eLibrary. And our readers have downloaded over 50 million full text documents (currently running at more than 8.5 million downloads per year).",
