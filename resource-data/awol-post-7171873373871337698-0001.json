    "description": "The ancient Egyptian city of Tell el-Amarna (or simply Amarna) was the short-lived capital built by the \u2018heretic\u2019 Pharaoh Akhenaten and abandoned shortly after his death (c. 1332 BCE). It was here that he pursued his vision of a society dedicated to the cult of one god, the power of the sun (the Aten). As well as this historic interest Amarna remains the largest readily accessible living-site from ancient Egypt. It is thus simultaneously the key to a chapter in the history of religious experience and to a fuller understanding of what it was like to be an ancient Egyptian. There is no other site like it.Download Horizon newsletter Issue 13, Summer 2013 PDF Download Horizon newsletter Issue 12, Spring 2013 PDF Download Horizon newsletter Issue 11, Summer 2012 PDF Download Horizon newsletter Issue 10, Winter 2012 PDF Download Horizon newsletter Issue 9, Summer 2011 PDF Download Horizon newsletter Issue 8, Winter 2010 PDF Download Horizon newsletter Issue 7, Spring 2010 PDF Download Horizon newsletter Issue 6, Autumn 2009 PDF Download Horizon newsletter Issue 5, March 2009 PDF Download Horizon newsletter Issue 4, September 2008 PDF Download Horizon newsletter Issue 3, April 2008 PDF Download Horizon newsletter Issue 2, July 2007 PDF Download Horizon newsletter Issue 1, October 2006 PDF Guide Books Guide Book: Central City Guide book: North TombsGuide book: South TombsGuide book: Royal Tomb",
