    "description": "The Journal of Roman Studies ISSN: 0075-4358 JSTOR Coverage: 1911-2005 (Vols. 1-95) Moving Wall: 3 years The Journal of Roman Studies publishes papers in the full range of the field which the Roman Society was established to promote, i.e. 'the study of the history, archaeology, literature and art of Italy and the Roman Empire, from the earliest times down to about A.D. 700'. The emphasis is on historical themes, but there are also articles on literary, archaeological and art historical topics, including issues of cultural and intellectual history that cut across these categories. Papers are intended to make a fresh and significant contribution to the understanding of the Roman world and to stimulate further discussion. Articles primarily on the archaeology of Roman Britain are published in the Society's sister journal, Britannia. The usual month of publication is November. The contents list and abstracts of the most recent volume are available on the Society's web-page, as are the contents of the five preceding volumes.",
