    "description": "The Classical Weekly. ISSN: 1940-641X. [Early (out of copyright) content in JSTOR is free of paywall restrictions and open access]. The mission of the Classical Association of the Atlantic States (CAAS), founded in 1907, is to strengthen teaching and research and foster public support for the languages, civilizations, and cultures of ancient Greece and Rome in the mid-Atlantic region (Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania). In furtherance of this mission, the annual fall meeting in the region during Columbus Day weekend features papers and panels on many classical topics, sessions on new directions in teaching and research, and workshops on professional issues. All members receive Classical World, the Association's quarterly journal, which publishes articles and reviews for \"the scholarly teacher and the teaching scholar,\" including regular surveys of textbooks and audio-visual materials in Classics. The Hahn Rome/Athens scholarship offers substantial support to a CAAS member for summer study abroad, and CAAS also provides grants for many different types of public projects promoting the Classics.",
