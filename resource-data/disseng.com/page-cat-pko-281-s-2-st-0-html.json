Twenty-five page samples of each title are offered, but were not available for any that I tried. The service promises, for a reasonable fee, to be able to supply a pdf of the each dissertation in one day, or for slightly more a pdf + machine translation in two days. Prices for pdf + professional translation depend on the size of the work and requires 5-10 days. I have not yet tried to order a copy. If anyone has, I would appreciate comment below.",
