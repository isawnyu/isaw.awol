    "description": "Hellenistic Babylonia: Texts, Images and Names. More than 3,000 cuneiform clay tablets document the intellectual, religious, scientific, legal and economic activities in Hellenistic Mesopotamia. Originating primarily from Uruk and Babylon, these texts show that although Alexander the Great and his successors transformed much of the cultural landscape of western and central Asia, they left many native practices and institutions intact. Hellenistic Babylonia: Texts, Images and Names presents to Assyriologists, Classicists, ancient historians and others the evidence necessary for study of Mesopotamia at the time when traditional culture came under the powers of the Hellenistic world. Three primary areas of this website include up-to-date and readable publication of the materials necessary for an integrated study of Hellenistic Mesopotamia: Texts: transliterations and translations into English of texts from the major sites of Uruk and Babylon. Images: drawings and photographs of seal impressions on Hellenistic cuneiform texts. Names: prosopographical data and family trees of the great lineages of the major sites.",
