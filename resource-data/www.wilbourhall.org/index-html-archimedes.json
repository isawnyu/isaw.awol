    "description": "Mathematics and Mathematical Astronomy. I hope to make available public domain materials that are essential for the study of ancient and early modern mathematics and mathematical astronomy. Google, for example, has done some things to achieve this through its books. google. com project. However, like most other efforts at digitally copying non digital materials, \"mistakes were made\". For example, Google currently has several (all incomplete) versions of Teubner's's edition of Euclid available for download. Most of these unfortunately contain page after page that are illegible, missing, out of order or otherwise unusable. Most of the works available here were made by repairing the imperfect Google scans. This repairing has taken the form of replacing illegible or missing pages of one Google text with readable pages from another Google scan of the same text, splicing together readable portions of pages with Photoshop, replacing missing pages with scans from a local library, and replacing missing pages with transcriptions in TeX, a mathematical typesetting software, from copies that are too brittle to scan.",
