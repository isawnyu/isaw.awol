    "description": "[First posted in AWOL 1 August 2011. Updated 15 August\u00a0 2014]. Parekbolai. An Electronic Journal for Byzantine Literature. ISSN: 2241-0228. PAREKBOLAI is an electronic journal, which is published yearly by an Editorial Committee of Byzantinists of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. The name is inseparably linked with the well-known Commentaries of Eustathius of Thessalonica, and was chosen as a sign of both the journal\u2019s association with the University of Thessaloniki as host institution and its subject matter. The journal publishes original articles on Byzantine Literature and Philology as well as related text-based studies covering the period from the 4 th to the 15 th centuries in English, French, German, Greek, and Italian. All articles submitted will be peer-reviewed by two members of the journal\u2019s International Editorial Advisory Board, and once approved will be uploaded immediately as pdf files, which will be created by the Editors in consultation with the authors. 2011 Vol 1 (2011) 2012 Vol 2 (2012) 2013 Vol 3 (2013) 2014 Vol 4 (2014).
