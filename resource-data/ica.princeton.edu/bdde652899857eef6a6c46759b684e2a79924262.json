    "description": "Index of Christian Art Digital Books. Welcome to The Index of Christian Art online publications! In the firm belief that we all need to share as much scholarship as is possible, the Index of Christian Art is pleased to present an occasional series of online conference proceedings and papers. When it is not possible to publish in the traditional hardcopy format we will use the Internet for online publications. The first set of papers are the conference proceedings from a one day event held in Princeton University on Thursday July 12th 2012 which was devoted to Digitization and The Arts. The papers from that colloquium are presented here as they were delivered and preserve the spontaneity of the speakers. Short biographies are included.
