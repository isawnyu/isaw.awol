    "description": "[First posted in AWOL 8 December 2013, updated 18 May 2015]. Greek Manuscripts in Sweden. Welcome to the project homepage of Greek Manuscripts in Sweden. The aim of this project is to digitize and catalogue all the Greek manuscripts in Sweden. Around 120 Greek manuscripts are kept in Swedish libraries, but only a few of them have up to now been available in digital form online. Libraries that contribute material to the database include Gothenburg University Library (4 MSS), Link\u00f6ping Diocesan Library (29 MSS), Lund University Library (5 MSS), Nationalmuseum, Stockholm (1 MS), The Royal Library, Stockholm (5 MSS), The Skokloster Castle Library (3 MSS), and Uppsala University Library (74 MSS). The project is run by two researchers, Dr. Eva Nystr\u00f6m and Dr. Patrik Granholm, in collaboration with photographers and computer specialists at Uppsala University Library. The Central Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation has contributed financial support.",
