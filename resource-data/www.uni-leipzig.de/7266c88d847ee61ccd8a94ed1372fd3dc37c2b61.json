    "description": "Database and Dictionary of Greek Loanwords in Coptic (DDGLC). The DDGLC project is hosted by the Egyptological Institute -Georg Steindorff- of the University of Leipzig and funded by the Deutsche Forschungs\u00adgemeinschaft as a long-term project with a projected lifespan ranging through 2024. The DDGLC project seeks to produce a systematic, comprehensive and detailed lexicographical compilation and description of Greek loanwords as attested in the entire Coptic corpus through every dialect, each kind of text, and in pre-Coptic Egyptian. The project will thus eventually record 1500 years of contact-induced language change of the Egyptian-Coptic language. The results of the project shall be made available in an online database and in a printed dictionary. The core tool of the DDGLC project is currently a relational database designed to connect linguistic and extra-linguistic data concerning types and tokens of all identifiable Greek loanwords in Coptic.",
