    "description": "Ancient Near Eastern Route Systems: From the Ground Up (Nov. 2007). A particularly common trace of ancient route systems on the ground is the 'hollow way'. In the Middle East hollow ways, like their counterparts in the UK and Europe, appear as long, usually straight valleys. This paper examines the traces of these ancient route systems in the Ancient Near East according to their pattern, processes of formation, parallels elsewhere, and their function. <tr> <td><a href=\"http://www. archatlas. org/workshop/Philip07. php\"></a></td> <td class=\"small\"> Graham Philip, Department of Archaeology, University of Durham <br/><a href=\"http://www. archatlas. org/workshop/Philip07. php\"><cite>Unscrambling the 'Uplands': Satellite Imagery and the Homs Basalts<cite></cite></cite></a> (Oct. 2007).

In this case we focus on an upland landscape, where stone architecture is the expectation. In the traditional literature, most discussion of such areas has concentrated upon the evidence for activity of Graeco-Roman date - the Dead Cities of the Limestone Massif on north-western Syria are an excellent example. However, we have very little knowledge of the evidence for earlier periods. This is, we suspect, because we have little idea of what we should be looking for. </td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href=\"http://www. archatlas. org/workshop/Philip07. php\"></a></td> <td class=\"small\"> Graham Philip, Department of Archaeology, University of Durham <br/><a href=\"http://www. archatlas. org/workshop/Philip07. php\"><cite>Unscrambling the 'Uplands': Satellite Imagery and the Homs Basalts<cite></cite></cite></a> (Oct. 2007).
