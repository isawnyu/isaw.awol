    "description": "Contagious Processes (2005). Archaeologists have long recognised (though in practice tend to forget) the degree to which developments in one part of the world were affected by things happening elsewhere. These animated maps of the spread of farming and of urbanism are intended to show a fundamental aspect of long-term human history: the underlying patterns of concentric expansion which have characterised cultural change in the Holocene. <tr> <td><a href=\"http://www. archatlas. org/Portages/Portages. php\"></a></td> <td class=\"small\"> Andrew Sherratt <br/><a href=\"http://www. archatlas. org/Portages/Portages. php\"><cite>Portages<cite></cite></cite></a> (2005). Early trading networks carried relatively small quantities of valuable goods, often over considerable distances, both by land and water. The relationship between overland transport and carriage by river or sea helps to explain why trading centres rose to prominence at certain key positions on these routes. With very small quantities of goods, light vessels might be carried over short distances between rivers; and even when the bulk of traded goods increased, it might still be advantageous to carry the goods for short distances overland from one port to another. Sites at such break-of-bulk points became major nodes in the transport network. This presentation explores the changing geometry of early trade-routes, and especially the interface between land and sea. </td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href=\"http://www. archatlas. org/Portages/Portages. php\"></a></td> <td class=\"small\"> Andrew Sherratt <br/><a href=\"http://www. archatlas. org/Portages/Portages. php\"><cite>Portages<cite></cite></cite></a> (2005).
