    "description": "Unscrambling the 'Uplands': Satellite Imagery and the Homs Basalts (Oct. 2007). This presentation forms part of a a collaborative British-Syrian project called Settlement and Landscape Development in the Homs Region, Syria, that seeks to compare human activity in adjacent but contrasting landscapes in a typical part of western Syria. In this case we focus on an upland landscape, where stone architecture is the expectation. In the traditional literature, most discussion of such areas has concentrated upon the evidence for activity of Graeco-Roman date - the Dead Cities of the Limestone Massif on north-western Syria are an excellent example. However, we have very little knowledge of the evidence for earlier periods. This is, we suspect, because we have little idea of what we should be looking for. <tr> <td><a href=\"http://www. archatlas. org/workshop/Petrie07. php\"></a></td> <td class=\"small\"> Cameron Petrie, Department of Archaeology, University of Cambridge <br/><a href=\"http://www. archatlas. org/workshop/Petrie07. php\"><cite>Remote Sensing in Inaccessible Lands: Plains and preservation along old routes between Pakistan and Afghanistan<cite></cite></cite></a> (Sept. 2007).
