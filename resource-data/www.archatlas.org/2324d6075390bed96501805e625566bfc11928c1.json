    "description": "Andean Civilizations: Peru, South America (from Space) (2004) Few areas of the world include such spectacular environmental contrasts as the Andean coast of South America, with its coastal deserts and riverine oases, mountains and inter-montane valleys, and tropical rainforest interior. This complexity underlay the formation of the New World's indigenous civilisations, from the first temple-builders to the Inka. These developments are usefully seen by satellite, which reveals for instance the astonishing phenomenon of the Nazca lines \u2013 \"seen\" by shamans in spirit-flight, long before the first satellite was launched.
