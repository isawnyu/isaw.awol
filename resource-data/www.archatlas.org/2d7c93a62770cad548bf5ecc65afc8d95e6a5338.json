    "description": "Why an electronic atlas of archaeology? (2004). When astronauts first took photographs of Earth from space, it transformed traditional images of the planet. Here, for the first time, were photographs of the world as it actually is. Systematic use of this information was at first confined to military objectives, but nowadays these images are familiar, as the backdrop to news items and weather forecasts. Moreover, they are now available as continuous cover, and can themselves be used as maps. ArchAtlas began in Oxford in 2000, as a means of making available the kinds of images and interpretations which are more easily disseminated through a website than by conventional paper publication. <tr> <td><a href=\"http://www. archatlas. org/Trade/Trade. php\"></a></td> <td class=\"small\"> Andrew Sherratt <br/><a href=\"http://www. archatlas. org/Trade/Trade. php\"><cite>Trade Routes: the Growth of Global Trade<cite></cite></cite></a> (2004).
