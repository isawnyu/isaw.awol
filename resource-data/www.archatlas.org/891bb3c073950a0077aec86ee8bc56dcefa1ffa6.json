    "description": "International Dunhuang Project aims to reunite this material by making it freely available online. One part of this project includes the mapping of archaeological sites, and the digitisation of data from archaeological data collected by Aurel Stein and other researchers, using tools such as Google Earth to help users to better understand the history of the Tarim Basin and its cultures. <tr> <td><a href=\"http://www. archatlas. org/workshop09/works09-wordsworth. php\"></a></td> <td class=\"small\"> Paul D.
