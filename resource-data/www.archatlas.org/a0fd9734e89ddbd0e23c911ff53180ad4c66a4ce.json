    "description": "The CIERA program and activities: focus on the roads and wayside caravanserais in medieval Syria (Oct. 2009). New research is currently being carried out in order to collect supplementary data, both historical and archaeological, on the road networks of Medieval Bil\u0101d al-\u0160\u0101m and their related facilities. Supported by the material evidence of caravanserais, the aim of the research is to propose a reconstruction and a preliminary analysis of the region's communication axis from the beginning of the Ayyubid period till the end of the Mamluk. The preliminary character of the reflections offered in this article will hopefully be pursued more thoroughly in the completion of a larger project now in its final phase. <tr> <td><a href=\"http://www. archatlas. org/workshop09/works09-wilkinson. php\"></a></td> <td class=\"small\"> Toby Wilkinson, University of Sheffield <br/><a href=\"http://www. archatlas. org/workshop09/works09-wilkinson. php\"><cite>Pathways and highways: routes in Bronze Age Eurasia<cite></cite></cite></a> (Oct. 2009). This visual essay explores the possibility of delineating two different types of routes, \"pathways\" and \"highways\", and the extent to which archaeology can help to analyse them. The technologies of cost-raster GIS analysis are introduced and applied to two case studies in Eastern Anatolia and Western Central Asia, c. 3000-1000 BC. It is to be hoped that the highlighted patterns, combined with a knowledge of contemporary material transformations, will provide insights into the processes of socio-economic change across these reconstructed networks of interaction. </td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href=\"http://www. archatlas. org/workshop09/works09-wilkinson. php\"></a></td> <td class=\"small\"> Toby Wilkinson, University of Sheffield <br/><a href=\"http://www. archatlas. org/workshop09/works09-wilkinson. php\"><cite>Pathways and highways: routes in Bronze Age Eurasia<cite></cite></cite></a> (Oct. 2009).
