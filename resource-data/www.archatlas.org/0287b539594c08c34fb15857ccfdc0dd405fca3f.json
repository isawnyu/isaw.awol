    "description": "Obsidian Trade in the Near East, 14,000 to 6500 BC (2005). Obsidian, a black volcanic glass, was first recognized by Colin Renfrew and his colleagues J. E. Dixon and J. R. Cann in the 1960s as a uniquely sensitive indicator of prehistoric trade, both because of the great desirability of this material before the use of metals, and also because the trace-elements it contains are usually diagnostic of individual sources. Based on data extracted from M. -C. Cauvin et al. , L'obsidienne au Proche et Moyen Orient: du volcan \u00e0 l'outil (Oxford: BAR Int. Ser. 738), maps indicate the flows of material from two major source-areas. <tr> <td><a href=\"http://www. archatlas. org/Panoramas/Panoramas. php\"></a></td> <td class=\"small\"> Andrew Sherratt and Toby Wilkinson <br/><a href=\"http://www. archatlas. org/Panoramas/Panoramas. php\"><cite>Panoramas<cite></cite></cite></a> (2005).
