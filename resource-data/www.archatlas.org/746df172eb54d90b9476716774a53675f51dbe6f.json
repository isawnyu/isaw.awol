    "description": "%IMAGEREPLACED% Andrew Sherratt and Francesco Menotti Sites and Landscapes in 3D (VRML images) (2006) If we have elevation data (conventionally represented by contour-lines) and satellite imagery, why not combine the two? This allows a site to be represented not just in a vertical view, but as it is seen from different viewpoints. Why not combine them all, so that it can be examined from all angles, flown over, walked through? These are some examples of famous areas and sites. A hint of the future, when such representations will be routine. Andrew Sherratt and Francesco Menotti Sites and Landscapes in 3D (VRML images)",
