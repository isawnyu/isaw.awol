    "description": "%IMAGEREPLACED% Andrew Sherratt and Toby Wilkinson Panoramas (2005) Understanding the setting of an archaeological site has two components: an experience of its location, from a human standpoint (standing, sitting, observing), and an appreciation of its position (on a map, an aerial photograph, or a satellite image). The first gives a situated view of the landscape, unlike the abstract, distanced view. Panoramas thus offer a natural complement to the vertical or near-vertical views which predominate on these web-pages. Andrew Sherratt and Toby Wilkinson Panoramas",
