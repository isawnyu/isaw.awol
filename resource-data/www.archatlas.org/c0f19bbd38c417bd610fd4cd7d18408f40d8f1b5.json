    "description": "Paul D. Wordsworth, Institute of Archaeology, University College, London Traversing the Karakum: Approaches to defining trade networks through the desert landscapes of Medieval Central Asia (Oct. 2010). In our imagination of the 'Silk Routes', we envisage travellers, traders and intellectuals traversing vast continents for the purpose of exchanging rare and precious items. The archaeological study of these routes has usually focused on transmitted artefacts and ideas, as opposed to the means and methods by which they were carried. The resultant void of knowledge concerning the infrastructure of the Silk Roads, and the nature of the settlements that shaped and were shaped by them, presents a challenge to archaeologists from both a methodological and theoretical perspective.
