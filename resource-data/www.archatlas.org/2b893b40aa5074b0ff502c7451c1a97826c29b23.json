    "description": "Sites from Satellites (2004). The resolution of satellite-imagery in the public domain is constantly improving. Although images with the resolution hitherto obtainable by aerial photographs are still expensive, imagery with a resolution of 15m or better is routinely available for most parts of the world, thanks principally to NASA. For some areas, this is already better than most maps. It is especially useful in areas with strong vegetational contrasts depending on water-sources. Selected key sites are presented here, as they can be seen from space. <tr> <td><a href=\"http://www. archatlas. org/SouthAmerica/SouthAmerica. php\"></a></td> <td class=\"small\"> Andrew Sherratt and Francesco Menotti <br/><a href=\"http://www. archatlas. org/SouthAmerica/SouthAmerica. php\"><cite>Andean Civilizations: Peru, South America (from Space)<cite></cite></cite></a> (2004). Few areas of the world include such spectacular environmental contrasts as the Andean coast of South America, with its coastal deserts and riverine oases, mountains and inter-montane valleys, and tropical rainforest interior. This complexity underlay the formation of the New World's indigenous civilisations, from the first temple-builders to the Inka. These developments are usefully seen by satellite, which reveals for instance the astonishing phenomenon of the Nazca lines \u2013 \"seen\" by shamans in spirit-flight, long before the first satellite was launched. </td></tr> <tr> <td><a href=\"http://www. archatlas. org/SouthAmerica/SouthAmerica. php\"></a></td> <td class=\"small\"> Andrew Sherratt and Francesco Menotti <br/><a href=\"http://www. archatlas. org/SouthAmerica/SouthAmerica. php\"><cite>Andean Civilizations: Peru, South America (from Space)<cite></cite></cite></a> (2004).
