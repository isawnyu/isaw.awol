    "description": "Quantitative approaches to the remote sensing of ancient settlements in the Near East using ASTER and SRTM data (July 2007). Tells, the characteristic settlement mounds of the Near East, are visible remains of the first human settlement system. Often piled up to considerable heights by the debris of millennia of settlement activity, they provide characteristic physical signatures, such as specific elevation profiles or soil changes, which \u2013 potentially \u2013 can be detected in data available from space-borne sensors. Using methods from pattern recognition and statistical learning, we systematically evaluated digital elevation models and multispectral imagery to provide means for a machine based detection and mapping of these archaeologically relevant settlement sites. <tr> <td><a href=\"http://www. archatlas. org/workshop/Wilkinson. php\"></a></td> <td class=\"small\"> Toby Wilkinson, British Institute at Ankara <br/><a href=\"http://www. archatlas. org/workshop/Wilkinson. php\"><cite>Virtual globes, geotagging and global landscapes: visualisation and database technologies in the age of the Internet<cite></cite></cite></a> (July 2007).
