    "description": "Environmental Change: the evolution of Mesopotamia (2004). The areas that were occupied by early farmers and town-dwellers were often very different from the landscapes that can be seen in the same areas today. Some of the most important changes took place in the great river basins where urban civilisation first emerged. Southern Mesopotamia (Iraq), the land of the two rivers, has been transformed over the last six thousand years by the changing relationships between rivers, land and sea. Although the pattern has not yet been reconstructed in detail, satellite imagery can be used to outline the major processes of change, and to visualise what an extraordinary landscape this was at the time of the first cities. <tr> <td><a href=\"http://www. archatlas. org/project/introduction. php\"></a></td> <td class=\"small\"> Andrew Sherratt <br/><a href=\"http://www. archatlas. org/project/introduction. php\"><cite>Why an electronic atlas of archaeology?<cite></cite></cite></a> (2004).
