    "description": "The Center for the Study of New Testament Manuscripts (CSNTM): Manuscripts The requirements that need to be satisfied for using these images in publication vary from manuscript to manuscript. Each possessing institute or individual has its own requirements. If you wish to publish any of these images, you will need to get permission from CSNTM first. We can then direct you to the contact person of the institute that owns the manuscript(s) for further instructions. CSNTM does not charge for the use of these images, though the institute that owns the manuscripts may. At minimum, CSNTM needs to be credited with the photographs and the possessing institute needs to be credited with ownership of the manuscript in all research for which these images are used. For more information about usage of manuscript images, contact In order to find your way through the images of manuscripts, you should download the scripture index for each manuscript (it's the first document on each manuscript's page). Only a few manuscripts currently have a scripture index, but more are coming. The Center for the Study of New Testament Manuscripts (CSNTM) is continuing to grow its online resources. Today we are proud to announce that we now have i mages of 128 papyri manuscripts in our archives, 111 digital papyri manuscripts online, and 80 of these available publically (the remaining are available for private viewing only due to contractual arrangements).",
