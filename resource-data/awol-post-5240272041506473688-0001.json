    "description": "Founded in 2010, Dissertation Reviews is a new site that features overviews of recently defended, unpublished doctoral dissertations in a wide variety of disciplines across the Humanities and Social Sciences.\u00a0Our goal is to offer readers a glimpse of each discipline\u2019s immediate present by focusing on the window of time between dissertation defense and first book publication.Each review provides a summary of the author\u2019s main arguments, the historiographic genealogy in which the author operates, and the main source bases for his or her research.\u00a0The reviews are also anticipatory, making educated assessments of how the research will advance or challenge our understanding of major issues in the field when it is revised and published in the future.Dissertation Reviews also features reviews of and guides to archives, libraries, databases, and other collections where such dissertation research was conducted, to help scholars improve their ability to undertake current and future research.For more information about our project:- Request a Review of Your Dissertation- Become a Reviewer- Editorial Board-\u00a0Dissertation Reviews Advisory Boards- Frequently Asked Questions- New Fields in 2012-13- Seeking New Editors and Fields",
