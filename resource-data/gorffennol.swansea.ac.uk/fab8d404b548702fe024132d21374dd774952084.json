    "description": "Gorffennol: The Swansea University History and Classics Online Journal and Blog. Gorffennol is the Welsh for Past. It is the online student journal of the History and Classics Department at Swansea University. It will produce two journal issues a year as well as regular blog posts. It is run by an editorial team consisting of 10 students and two members of staff from the Department. The online journal will be published biannually and will showcase outstanding student assignments from all subject areas in our Department (hence \u2018Past\u2019 as this includes everything from ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome through the Medieval period to the early modern and modern periods). There will also be regular blog posts by students and staff on module-specific research. There will be links to it from module Blackboard sites, so our Departmental students can look at what excellent work in particular modules looks like. We are grateful for the funding this project has received from the Swansea Academy of Learning and Teaching (SALT). It will work as a pilot project not only to display excellent student work, but also to help our students increase their career skills by providing them with editorial experience. We hope to open up the journal to all Arts and Humanities students once the pilot stage of this project is over. The editorial team are being guided by Dr Evelien Bracke on a weekly basis and have also received a talk by Prof Thomas Jansen (TSD) who coordinates the Student Journal at Trinity Saint David.",
