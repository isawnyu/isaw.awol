    "description": "Lowell Thomas and Lawrence of Arabia: Making a Legend - Creating History T.E. Lawrence, a young British captain wearing Arab robes, helps lead a hodgepodge Arab army hundreds of miles across the desert to capture the port of Akaba. Lawrence is a complex, conflicted figure who accidentally shoots his own camel in the head during the climactic battle. Lowell Thomas, who became one of America\u2019s most famous journalists, transforms Lawrence\u2019s story into a multimedia show seen after the war by more than four million people. In Thomas\u2019 romanticized telling, for example, Lawrence\u2019s camel is shot out from under him. Thomas\u2019 show helps create the legend of \u201cLawrence of Arabia.\u201d And, elevated by his fame, Lawrence plays a major role in the conferences that help create the modern Middle East.
