Horn envisioned a journal that would provide a scholarly venue for the Seventh-day Adventist Theological Seminary faculty, students, and alumni, as well as other biblical scholars around the world. In the fifty years of publication since this vision was initiated. AUSS has published articles by Adventist, Catholic, Evangelical, and Jewish scholars throughout the world. A refereed journal, AUSS provides a scholarly venue, within the context of biblical faith, for the presentation of research in the area of religious and biblical studies. Specifically, AUSS publishes research articles, dissertation abstracts, and book reviews on the following topics: biblical archaeology and the history of antiquity; Hebrew Bible; New Testament; church history of all periods; historical, biblical, systematic, and philosophical theology; ethics; history of religions; and mission. Selected research articles on ministry and Christian education may also be included. Archives. Content of AUSS is also hosted at.",
