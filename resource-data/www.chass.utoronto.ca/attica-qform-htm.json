The possible searches range from selecting every person in a particular deme or of a specified profession to more sophisticated searches, e. g. to find all Athenians who lived between specified years and/or are related to a certain person and/or are attested in a class of document, etc. The results of searches give an up-to-date version of the data in the printed volume (the 'formatted version'), now with transliterated Greek texts. The search form is divided into fields similar to those in the computer database; these do not always correspond exactly to the position in which the information appears in the formatted version. The fields shown in the search form are detailed below, with a summary of the database information from the 'Description of Entries' appearing in each of the printed volumes, together with additional information about the contents of each field to help in the defining of search terms.
