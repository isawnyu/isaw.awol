    "description": "Bulletin of Information on Computing and Anthropology (BICA)The occasion for writing this piece was the editorial labour in preparing an online version of BICA The Bulletin of Information on Computing in Anthropology which is now available on the Internet. 1 The original BICA was a pioneering serial,2 edited by John Davis, which appeared intermittently from 1984 to 1988. Its early editions are of continuing interest for a variety of reasons, as attested by the citation of its articles in mainstream journals. BICA was originally published on a more or less samizdat basis. It was not sold, but distributed to about 500 subscribers. Its primary purpose was to promote the use of technology in anthropological research. Topics ranged from discussions of the use of expert systems to elucidate marriage patterns and musical improvisations, to the general problems of using computers in the field (the importance of peanut butter as a means of extracting pests from within a computer is not to be overlooked).",
