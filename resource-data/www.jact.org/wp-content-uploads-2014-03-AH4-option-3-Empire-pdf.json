    "description": "Ancient History Teachers\u2019 Notes. These teachers\u2019 notes are intended to prepare teachers for the new OCR specification by covering the main aspects of each of the optional subjects. They contextualise the prescribed sources and identity which issues and sources are most relevant to the individual bullet points of the specification. They will also give relevant extra background information. They are designed to complement, rather than replace, the materials provided by OCR. The format of the notes varies depending on their authors. Those for AH2 options 2 and 3 are set out as schemes of work, while the others address the specific bullet points identified in the specification. For other week by week lesson plans/schemes of work, please see the support material booklets provided by OCR. Bibliographies for each of the options are in the Teacher support booklet.
