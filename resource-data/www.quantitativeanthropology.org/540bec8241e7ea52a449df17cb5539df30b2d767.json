    "description": "Journal of Quantitative Anthropology. The primary purpose of the journal is the advancement of quantitative research in anthropology. The journal will provide a forum for scientific research, methodological developments, computer applications, and other subjects of interest to anthropologists in the traditional subdisciplines of biological/physical anthropology, archeology, and social/cultural anthropology, including linguistic anthropology. Although traditional in subdisciplinary breadth, the journal will highlight new developments in quantitative methods and modeling and computer applications in anthropology. Of particular interest will be articles that introduce new mathematical and statistical methods, empirical research applying new or innovative quantitative or systematic approaches, articles that are of both theoretical and methodological quantitative interest, and articles involving computer simulations and modeling. We also welcome articles providing qualitative discussions of fundamental analytical problems and theoretical issues, especially if these cross the subdisciplinary boundaries in new and interesting ways. The Journal of Quantitative Anthropology is no longer published. This site provides open access to articles that prior to the development of this site could only be found in university libraries. There are many fine articles published in the 7 years of the journals\u2019 existence and they are now available for all. 1996 Vol 6, No 4 (1996) Vol 6, No 3 (1996) Vol 6, No 1 - 2 (1996). 1995 Vol 5, No 4 (1995) Vol 5, No 3 (1995) Vol 5, No 2 (1995) Vol 5, No 1 (1995). 1994 Vol 4, No 4 (1994). 1993 Vol 4, No 3 (1993) Vol 4, No 2 (1993). 1992 Vol 4, No 1 (1992) Vol 3, No 4 (1992). 1991 Vol 3, No 3 (1991) Vol 3, No 2 (1991) Vol 3, No 1 (1991). 1990 Vol 2, No 4 (1990) Vol 2, No 3 (1990) Vol 2, No 2 (1990) Vol 2, No 1 (1990). 1989 Vol 1, No 4 (1989) Vol 1, No 3 (1989) Vol 1, No 1 - 2 (1989).
