    "description": "AROURA Reports Archaeological Reconnaissance of Uninvestigated Remains of Agriculture (AROURA) is an archaeological geophysics and surface survey of the plain around the 13th century BCE fortress of Glas, Boiotia, central mainland Greece, beginning in October 2010 and lasting until November 2012. It aims to detail the Mycenaean hydraulic, drainage, and land-improvement works around the fortress, and to search for traces of the expected extensive agricultural system they served. AROURA is an official collaboration between the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), and the 9th Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities (IX EPCA) of the Hellenic Ministry of Culture and Sports, based in Thebes, Dr. M.F. Lane (UMBC) and Dr. A. Charami (IX EPCA) co-directors.",
