    "description": "[First posted in AWOL 17 October 2009. Updated 3 June 2014]. DIGITAL LIBRARY NUMIS. DLN is dedicated to the study of numismatics and it\u2019s main objective is to establish a major portal and open access repository for digital publications regarding coins, medals, monetary history and related subjects. The project was initially\u00a0developed\u00a0primarily\u00a0to provide an extensive compilation of\u00a0many rare, often\u00a0beautifully illustrated numismatic classics,\u00a0printed from the 16th until the early 20th century, which\u00a0can be downloaded or reproduced without\u00a0any copyright limitations. But as more and more authors and publishers nowadays are starting to share open access books and essays, we also explore a continually growing amount of contemporary references available online. DLN is in particular useful as a additional research tool for professional numismatists,\u00a0but also for historians, other scholars interested\u00a0in the field, branch libraries and bibliophiles. DLN is still under heavy construction and will be updated nearly on a daily base. If you have any comments, additional resources or reports on broken links please contact webmaster:.",
