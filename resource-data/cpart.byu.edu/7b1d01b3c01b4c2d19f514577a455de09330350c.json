    "description": "Brown Manuscripts The Syrian Orthodox Monastery of St. Mark in Jerusalem sits on the traditional site of the house of St. Mark the evangelist (cf. Acts 12:12). It is the seat of the Syrian Orthodox Archbishop of Jerusalem. Ignatius III lived there as Bishop in 1471, which is the earliest dated evidence for the monastery. The monastery houses a substantial collection of manuscripts (289 volumes are included in Dolabani\u2019s catalogue). Thirty one of these manuscripts were microfilmed in 1987/88 as part of an NEH funded project under the direction of Professor S. Kent Brown. A preliminary catalogue was prepared by William Macomber in 1990. SMC 1-1 Syrian Orthodox Church (Jacobite).
