    "description": "The Syrian Studies Association (SSA) is an international association organized to encourage and promote research and scholarly understanding of Syria in all academic disciplines. The SSA defines Syria as the area included in historic \"Bilad al-Sham\" until 1918 and Syria following that. We invite scholars who study the peoples and territories of what is today Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and Palestine before 1918 and those who study Syria after that to join our organization and to contribute to our newsletter. The Newsletter is particularly interested in articles on research and scholarship underway in Syria; reviews of new books on Syria, particularly those in Arabic\u00a0and\u00a0those that\u00a0are not widely distributed; and articles on research and study opportunities in Syria.",
