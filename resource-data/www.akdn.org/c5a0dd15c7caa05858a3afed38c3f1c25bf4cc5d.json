    "description": "AKTC Afghanistan Newsletter. Newsletters Documenting the Progress of Cultural Revitalisation Projects in Kabul and Herat These newsletters document the progress of the revitalisation projects of the Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC), which began the rehabilitation of Bagh-e-Babur, a walled and terraced garden containing the tomb of Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire, in 2002. The programme has expanded to include the 19th-century mausoleum in central Kabul over the grave of Timur Shah and a great number of homes, mosques and other structures in the war-damaged quarters of Asheqan wa Arefan, Chindawol and Kuche Kharabat. In Herat, in western Afghanistan, a range of documentation, conservation and upgrading works has also been carried out since 2005 in surviving historic sections of the old city.
