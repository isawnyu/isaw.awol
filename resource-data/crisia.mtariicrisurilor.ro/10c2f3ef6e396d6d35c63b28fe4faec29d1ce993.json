    "description": "Crisia. ISSN: 1016-2798. \"Crisia\" is a publication of the \u0162\u0103rii Cri\u015furilor Museum in Oradea and it was founded by Prof. Dr. Sever Dumitra\u015fcu. The annual of Oradea experienced three distinct phases in its development: 1971-1983, 1984-1989 and after 1990. In the first period \"Crisia\" was exclusively a publication of the department of history team of the museum of Oradea. During the period of 1984 - 1989, by abolishing the other magazines of the institution, \"Biharea\" and \"Nimphaea\", \"Crisia\" remained the only annual of this. After 1990 things returned to normal, \"Crisia\" becomes a prestigious publication, of wide intellectual breathing, open to the collaborators from country and abroad, the last numbers capture this reality abundantly. The stated goal of the magazine is that of publishing the results of the history and archeology researches, by studies and materials relating primarily to Bihor County but, also to other areas. By valorizing some unpublished and interesting information, it has greatly contributed to the development of the Transylvanian historiography. The materials present in the magazine have a balanced epoch layout. In time, during the 40 years of existence, \"Crisia\" noted itself firstly by constant. Few publications of this type had annual appearances as systematic as the annual of Oradea. This proves once again the seriousness and readiness to researching of the historians\u2019 team of the department of history of the museum of Oradea.",
