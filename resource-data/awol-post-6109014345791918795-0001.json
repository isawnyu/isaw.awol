    "description": "For those who love their subject and would like to work with young people there is no better career than Classics teaching. Not only does it give you the opportunity to draw on and develop your subject knowledge and communication skills, it also gives you significant responsibility and the freedom to use your imagination and creativity from the moment you enter the classroom. In the words of a trainee who moved into teaching after working for a number of years as an accountant: \u2018The thing that really made me leave was the fact that it didn\u2019t use all of me, and I wanted something that made me use my creativity, made me think on my feet.\u2019But a successful career in Classics teaching depends on having the thoroughness and professionalism of the training you receive when you start out on teaching. The aim of this site is to provide information on the different routes through training that are available for future Classics teachers.\u00a0\u00a0HOMEINITIAL TRAININGPGCEGTPRESEARCH PAPERSLINKSCONTACT",
