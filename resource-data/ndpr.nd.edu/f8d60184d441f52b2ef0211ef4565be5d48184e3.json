    "description": "Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews. ISSN: 1538 - 1617. Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews\u00a0began publication in January 2002. It is entirely devoted to publishing substantive, high-quality book reviews (normal length: 1500-2500 words). Reviews continually appear, usually five to twelve in the course of each week. Our goal is to review a good majority of the scholarly philosophy books issued each year and to have the review appear within six to twelve months of a book's publication. Reviews are commissioned and vetted by a distinguished international Editorial Board. We do not accept unsolicited reviews or proposals to review. The journal is published only electronically (available free, through e-mail subscription, RSS feed, and on this website).",
