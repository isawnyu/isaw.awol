    "description": "Julia Domna Inscriptions Author: Julie Langford This ongoing project aims to collect all inscriptions in which the Severan Empress Julia Domna is mentioned. A team of undergraduate researchers at the University of South Florida under the direction of Professor Julie Langford began the database with references to the 460 inscriptions published in Erich Kettenhofen\u2019s Die syrischen Augustae in der historischen \u00dcberlieferung published in Bonn by Rudolf Habelt in 1979. They gathered these and then mined L\u2019Annee Epigraphique for any other references to Julia Domna. Also employed in collecting these inscriptions were two invaluable online databases, the Packard Humanities Institute (http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/) and the Epigraphische Datenbank Clauss-Slaby (http://www.manfredclauss.de/). This database is being used by Julie Langford and graduate researchers at the University of South Florida to answer questions such as how, where and when the Empress was celebrated, whether she was honored in her own right or in conjunction with her male relatives, and how various populations responded to imperial propaganda concerning the Empress. This database will continue to grow as new inscriptions are published. Please call any errors or omissions to the attention of Prof. Julie Langford (jlangfor@cas.usf.edu).",
