The discussion of stratigraphy in this site is still intended to be integrated with the print publication, which contains both our interpretations of the data and the specialist studies of pottery, wall painting, sculpture, etc. The material presented in these pages may be useful even when read without reference to the print publication, but it is not meant to serve as a stand-alone work.
