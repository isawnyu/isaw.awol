    "description": "[First posted in AWOL 11 My 2011. Updated 24 March 2013]. The Bern Digital Pantheon Project. The Pantheon in Rome is one of the world\u2019s most famous buildings, and is also one of the best preserved examples of Roman architecture. However, although the Pantheon has been extensively studied by architects, historians and archaeologists since the Renaissance, many questions remain concerning its design, construction, engineering and building logistics as well as its original purpose. The Bern Digital Pantheon Project embraces an open access approach to its Digital Pantheon Model, which was created from the data of a digitisation operation that was carried out in December 2005 and July 2007 by two teams of archaeologists, engineers and historians of science, using state-of-the-art technology. This book displays some of the results. Data and high resolution images can be accessed from the project\u2019s web site, and, over time, more will become available to the general public. The international scientific community is invited to use the data for individual research purposes, to contribute information and make critiques, and to discuss the results online through special web interfaces. It is hoped that this will generate new ways of networking, particularly on scientific problems of broader inter- or multidisciplinary interests.",
