Strutture e ritrovamenti delle terrazze mediana e superiore Ilaria Caloi This work, based on my 2007 MA dissertation for the Italian Archaeological School at Athens focuses on two Protopalatial structures of Phaistos (Crete), located in an area known as the \u2018Quarter West to the West Court\u2019 (Piazzale I) of the Phaistos palace. The analytical study of stratigraphical/contextual data and MM IB-MM IIB ceramics retrieved from these two structures has been my starting point for attempting a new definition of the ceramic sequence of Protopalatial Phaistos, which consists of four ceramic phases (A-B-C-D) corresponding to Early MM IB, MM IB, MM IIA and MM IIB. The publication of the architecture and large ceramic assemblages from these two structures provides an important illustration of the first crucial phases of the palatial site of Phaistos and contributes to a better understanding of the history of this important Aegean Bronze Age site.",
