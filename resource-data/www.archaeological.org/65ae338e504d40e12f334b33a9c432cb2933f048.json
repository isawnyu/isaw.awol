AIA Blog Explore Our New Website June 21, 2010 | by AIA President C. Brian Rose When the Archaeological Institute of America (AIA) was established in 1879, the telephone was in its infancy and the radio was still a decade or more away. Inventors such as Bell, Tesla, and Marconi revolutionized how we communicated in the late 19th century, but even greater steps were made in the late 1930s, with the advent of television, and 1940s, with digital computers. During this time, the AIA reached out to the public through lectures and, beginning in 1948, with ARCHAEOLOGY magazine. But even then, the power of \u201cnew\u201d media was apparent, for example in the popularity of the 1950s television series \u201cWhat in the World?\u201d featuring artifacts, curators, and celebrities. Now when we talk of \u201cnew\u201d media, however, we generally mean Web-based stories, audio files, video, and the like. The Web itself arose in the mid-1990s, soon after which both ARCHAEOLOGY and the AIA had established sites. Today, we are taking another step in bringing the ancient world to the public, and to professional AIA Members, as we re-launch the AIA website. Our staff in Boston has spent many hours on this project, guided by Eti Bonn-Muller, the AIA\u2019s Manager of Online Communications (and ARCHAEOLOGY\u2019s Online Senior Editor) and Web Designer Am\u00e9lie Walker of Castle Builder Design. We hope you will find the site more user-friendly than before and even more informative about AIA\u2019s mission, programs, and Membership benefits. Please take some time to explore our new site\u2014and let us know what you think: leave comments and suggestions below.",
