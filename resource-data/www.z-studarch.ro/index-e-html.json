    "description": "Ziridava Studia Archaeologica. ISSN: 1224-7316. Ziridava Studia Archaeologica (ISSN 1224-7316), edited by the Arad Museum Complex, is a periodical of archaeology that is meant to continue the old Ziridava. One must state that Ziridava Studia Archaeologica is published annually and is printed in the month of December of each year. The periodical aims to publish studies on the archaeology of the Carpathian Basin, but also on the surrounding regions. Therefore, Ziridava Studia Archaeologica is envisioned, first of all, as a periodical with regional impact. One of the main goals of this academic initiative is to publish archaeological materials, but also older research remained unpublished and new research. The team also encourages and supports the publication of synthesis studies and modern approaches. The first volume of Ziridava was published in 1967, and 25 volumes were edited since then, until 2010. This periodical published studies from various disciplines such as archaeology, history, art history, museology, or ethnography. In time, several independent specialized periodicals were created from the larger Ziridava: Armonii Naturale (since 1996), Z\u0103randul (since 1999), Studii \u0219i comunic\u0103ri (since 1992). A final stage of this process of increased editorial specialization is the publication of a separate periodical of archaeology, Ziridava Studia Archaeologica. Since in specialized archaeological literature Ziridava was correlated to the institution of the Arad Museum, but also due to the numerous archaeological researches performed mainly in the Lower Mure\u0219 were published in the periodical from Arad, the editorial board has decided to preserve the name of the periodical. At the same time, in order to avoid braking the tradition and forgetting the efforts of the periodical\u2019s old editorial board, we have decided to continue the numbering the volumes with no. 26 (Ziridava Studia Archaeologica 26, 2012).",
