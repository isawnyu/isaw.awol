Syria, an annual journal, has been published uninterruptedly since 1920 by the French Institute of the Near East (Amman, Beirut, Damascus, Aleppo). The review is dedicated to the history and archaelogy of the Semitic Near East (Cyprus included) from Prehistory to the Islamic conquest. It publishes articles in all the disciplines related to this field of research, archaology, epigraphy, philology, history, art history\u00a0; these articles are sometimes gathered together in thematic issues, but usually each issue of Syria tries to give - by means of 12 to 18 articles -, a varied overview of research on the Ancient Near East. The languages in use are French, English, German, Italian, and Spanish. From time to time, the review also publishes topical notes, and normaly devotes in each issue an extensive section to reading notes on books published on the Ancient Near East.",
