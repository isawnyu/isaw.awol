    "description": "The ASA corpus is one of the most interesting collections of epigraphic documents of the Semitic world, first and foremost for its vastness. With its over 15,000 inscriptions, it is the first-hand, written documentation of the culture that flourished in South Arabia from the late second millennium BC to the sixth century AD. At present, CSAI contains a collection of some 6,000 texts digitized by the team of the University of Pisa directed by prof. Alessandra Avanzini.",
