    "description": "The Art of Making in Antiquity: Stoneworking in the Roman World. The Art of Making in Antiquity is an innovative digital project designed for the study of Roman stoneworking. Centred on the photographic archive of Peter Rockwell, this website aims to enhance current understanding of the carving process and to investigate the relationship between the surviving objects, the method and sequence of their production and the people who made them. The resource comprises around 2,000 images, largely Roman monuments with a selection of contextual sources, accompanied by analysis of the working practices underlying their making.
