    "description": "Digital Commons Network. The Digital Commons Network provides free access to full-text scholarly articles and other research from hundreds of universities and colleges worldwide. Curated by university librarians and their supporting institutions, this dynamic research tool includes peer-reviewed journal articles, book chapters, dissertations, working papers, conference proceedings, and other original scholarly work. Clicking \"Explore\" anywhere on the multicolored Discipline Wheel opens a Commons page for a particular academic discipline. From here, you may browse popular and recently added articles, search all content, or \"Follow\" authors and publications to receive monthly email updates on new work in that field. You'll never run into pay walls or empty records, because only full-text, open-access research and scholarship are included in the Network. The Digital Commons Network continues to grow thanks to the contributions of researchers, librarians, faculty, and students who believe that scholarship is a community enterprise. To learn more about the Digital Commons Network, see the Library Journal article, \"Uncommonly Open: The New Digital Commons Network. \"Classics Commons Sub-Disciplines.",
