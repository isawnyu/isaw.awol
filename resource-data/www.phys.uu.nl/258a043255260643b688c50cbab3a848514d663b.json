    "description": "The Babylonian Calendar. Introduction The Babylonian calendar was a lunisolar calendar based on the lunar phases which was used in Babylon and surrounding regions for administrative, commercial and ritualistic purposes. It consisted of twelve lunar months, each beginning on the evening (i. e. after sunset) of the first observed (or computed) lunar crescent after the astronomical new moon. The year began around the spring equinox and in order to keep the calendar in step with the seasons, an intercalary month was inserted at (semi-)regular intervals. At first the intercalary months were inserted at irregular intervals, based on the observed discrepancies between the calendar and the seasons, but after about 590 BCE a regular intercalation scheme consisting of seven intercalary months in a 19-year cycle was adopted. Babylonian Calendar Converter (626 BCE to 75 CE) The following calendar converter is based on the tables of the Babylonian calendar published in 1956 by Parker and Dubberstein and is valid from 626/25 BCE, the year before the accession of Nabopolassar, until 75/76 CE, i. e. year 386 of the Seleucid Era (SE). Outside this interval, the converter will give erroneous results. Note that years before 1 CE are given in astronomical notation, i. e. 0 = 1 BCE, \u20131 = 2 BCE, etc.",
