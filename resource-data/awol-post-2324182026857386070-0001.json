    "description": "This domain specific resolution service is called the Classical Works Knowledge Base (CWKB). This service allows for the assembly and maintenance of specialized knowledge about works within its domain and about online resources that can provide services related to those works. It understands the linking heuristics used by online text resources within its domain and is able to create for any given canonical citation one or many URLs that can take users to specific texts within these resources, and ideally to specific passages. Although our example, and the focus of our study, concerns Classical literature, such domain specific knowledge bases would operate in the same way for other disciplines.",
