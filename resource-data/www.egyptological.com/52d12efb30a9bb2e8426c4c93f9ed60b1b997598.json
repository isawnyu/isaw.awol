    "description": "Colloquy is the place for short pieces, quick reviews and informal articles on a vast variety of topics. There are also a frequently changing photo album contributed by readers, events and courses listings and our Discussion forum for asking questions, making suggestions and putting forward ideas. This section will be updated on an ad hoc basis. Expect to find a\u00a0 real mix of content here!. Each issue will include at least three major articles in the Journal and Magazine sections with many more features and reviews to browse and enjoy, which will be added to the website on a more regular and less formal basis. Our editorial and technical staff are all volunteers, and our writers all contribute articles free of charge. This enables us to operate both the Editions and the Magazine section without advertising or other commercial input. By accepting advertising in the Colloquy section we are able to pay hosting and other costs whilst ensuring that the magazine remains free of charge to all visitors. We very much hope that you enjoy Egyptological. Don\u2019t forget to get in touch with us if you have any questions or ideas.",
