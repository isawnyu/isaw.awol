    "description": "\u03a0\u039b\u0391\u03a4\u03a9\u039d - PLATO - PLATON - PLATONE - PLAT\u00d3NThe aim of this journal is to promote international dialogue on Plato across different languages and scholarly approaches. The journal has been established by the International Plato Society, founded in 1989. The Society also holds triennial symposia and occasional additional activities and supports regional Plato Societies. It also sponsors the publication of scholarly books on Plato, in collaboration with Academia Verlag, Sankt Augustin. It is open to all Plato scholars world-wide to read this journal, to make responses to the papers (which should be sent to the Editor and are subject to editorial moderation), and, in due course, to submit papers for inclusion in the journal. The languages of the journal are those of the International Plato Society, namely English, French, German, Italian and Spanish. For further inquiries, please send a message to Dimitri EL MURR",
