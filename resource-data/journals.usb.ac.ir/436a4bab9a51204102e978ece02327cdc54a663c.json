    "description": "Iranian Journal of Archaeological Studies. University of Sistan and Balouchestan. ISSN 2251-743X. The Archaeological Sciences Research Centre (ASRC) of the University of Sistan and Baluchestan (USB) was founded in 2009, with the aim to ensure interaction between archaeology and scientific disciplines engaged in studies of the past. The centre is the first and only Archaeological Sciences Research Centre in the whole country. Research in archaeological science has greatly influenced modern archaeology. Archaeologists gain significant insight and interpretation of data using techniques borrowed from physical and biological sciences and earth sciences. It has the potential to alter our understanding of the past.",
