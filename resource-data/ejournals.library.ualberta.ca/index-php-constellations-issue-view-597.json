    "description": "Constellations is a student-run, student-written, and student-reviewed undergraduate journal, using a traditional peer-review system common to academic journals. Constellations strives to provide a forum for young historians and classicists to have the experience of writing for an academic journal. In order to maximize the number of opportunities for undergraduate students to have their work published, Constellations is very broad in its scope and will accept papers on any topic that is historical or classical in scope, even from non-history or classics courses. Submissions are accepted from all of the University of Alberta campuses: Main Campus, Augustana and Campus St. Jean, and may be in either French or English.",
