    "description": "The Center for Celtic Studies at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee publishes the electronic journal e-Keltoi: Journal of Interdisciplinary Celtic Studies. The journal is an integral part of the Center's mission to promote and disseminate research and communication related to Celtic cultures, past and present, in the academic arena as well as for the general public. Web resources on Celtic Culture that are content-rich, reliable and current are rare, and are very much in demand. The journal provides free access to cutting-edge, peer-reviewed articles solicited to address specific themes from a range of cross-disciplinary and international perspectives. The goal is to make full use of the electronic medium in a way that cannot be equalled by print journals due to cost or formatting constraints: numerous full-color images per article; video and audio clips; links to other sites embedded in the text; etc. The Celtic world is an especially rich source of graphic images, material culture, and oral as well as performative traditions, all of which can be presented especially effectively in an electronic format.",
