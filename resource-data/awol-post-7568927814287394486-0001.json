    "description": "ARK (The Archaeological Recording Kit) is a web-based \u2018toolkit\u2019 for the collection, storage and dissemination of archaeological data. It includes data-editing, data-creation, data-viewing and data-sharing tools, all of which are delivered using a web-based front-end.\u00a0 It is designed to be adaptable to any digital or paper-based recording system, so does not dictate what or how the archaeologist records at a given site. Rather it provides a framework, an interface and a set of pre-fabricated digital tools for archaeological recording and data dissemination according to the unique needs of any given project. Based on industry standard data technologies (Apache/MySQL/PHP), ARK is completely opensource and standards-compliant.",
