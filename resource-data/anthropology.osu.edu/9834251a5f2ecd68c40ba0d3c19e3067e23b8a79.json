The Dental Anthropology Association is making these available as a professional courtesy to all interested parties\u2014the site is not password-protected. After downloading onto your computer, these files will open using version 6.0 or later of Adobe Acrobat. Each file is one issue of the journal. We developed these in one of two ways. For the older issues that had not been saved in electronic format, hard copies were scanned (at 300 dpi). The newer issues were generated using Adobe InDesign and then converted to PDF files.
