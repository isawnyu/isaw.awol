    "description": "Macadam Collections on funerary cones from The Sudan Library By Kento Zenihiro This website publishes manuscripts on the ancient Egyptian funerary cones, which were written by the late Norman de Garis Davies, a famous Egyptologist and epigrapher, and the late Miles Frederick Laming Macadam, a renowned archaeologist and philologist in the fields of both Egyptology and Nubiology. Here you will find available high-resolution pictures and transcribed JPEG images of all 958 pages that I found at The Sudan Library, Khartoum, wholly free of charge.",
