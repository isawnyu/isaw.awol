    "description": "Classics and Class in Britain (1789-1939) is an AHRC-funded research project based at King\u2019s College, London. Our primary aim is to present and amplify the many lost voices of British working-class men and women who engaged with ancient Greek and Roman culture throughout the period. We intend to show the richness and diversity of the responses to ancient Greece and Rome among those who are often considered to have been excluded from it. By presenting their stories now, via our growing digital archive, we also hope that their example may inspire a more inclusive atmosphere for participation in classical culture across society today, when the increasing cost of university education in Britain has made it even more urgent to explore the popular perception of Classics as an elitist subject available only to the rich and privileged.",
