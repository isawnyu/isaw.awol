The International Journal of Humanities is the first academic journal in the Islamic Republic of Iran published in English and Arabic by faculty of Humanities, Tarbiat Modarres University. The International Journal of Humanities is mainly devoted to the publication of original research, which brings fresh light to bear on the concepts, processes,and consequences of humanities in general.

The journal seeks to achieve the following objectives: - To promote inter-disciplinary research in all areas of the humanities. - To provide a forum for genuine and constructive dialogues between scholars in different fields of the humanities. - To assist researchers at the pre-and post-doctorate levels, with a wealth of new and original material. - To make ideas, topics, and processes in the humanities intelligible and accessible to both the interested public and scholars whose expertise might lie outside that subject matter. n. b. While not specifically ancient related, this journal includes substantial content in archaeology and ancient history - particularly in recent volumes. Articles in Press.
