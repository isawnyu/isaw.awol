Arheolo\u0161ki vestnik welcomes contributions referring primarily to the south- eastern Alpine, northern Adriatic, and western Balkan regions in the prehistoric, classical, and (early) medieval periods, with the main emphasis on Slovenia and neighbouring lands. Contributions are also welcome from those fields of natural science that illuminate the history and archaeology of this area in interdisciplinary projects. Arheolo\u0161ki vestnik is the central Slovenian archaeological journal, which publishes contributions according to criteria similar to those of Germania, Gallia, Acta Arch. Hung. , or Britannia, for example. Whether considerable in size and scope or quite brief, the editors will only accept MANUSCRIPTS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN AND WILL NOT BE PUBLISHED ELSEWHERE IN SUCH A FORM. The editors recommend that the articles be written concisely. All submitted manuscripts will be sent out for review.",
