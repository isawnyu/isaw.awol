    "description": "Arqueolog\u00eda Suramericana/Arqueologia Sul-Americana. South America is an active region in the production of archaeological knowledge and in the formulation of alternative approaches to the past, both from a disciplinary and a contextual point of view. Yet, there was no written medium to disseminate the cultural production of the sub-continent related to the discourses on the past based on objects. That is the reason behind the collective work of South American archaeologists for the creation of a new journal, Arqueolog\u00eda Suramericana/Arqueologia Sul-Americana, published by the Department of Anthropology, Universidad del Cauca (Colombia) and the Ph. D. Program on Social Sciences of the School of Humanities of the Universidad Nacional de Catamarca (Argentina), with the support of the World Archaeological Congress. According to WAC purposes, the journal aims to promote and spread the production of archaeology and related disciplines in South America, emphasizing a critical perspective that allows a dialogue with representations about the past that have been traditionally marginalized from academic spaces. The journal hopes to create bridges of understanding, communication, and discussion between the two large South American worlds, Brazil and the Spanish-speaking countries, which have consistently ignored each other for so long. It is sad that the barrier of two similar languages have split the sub-continent in such a way, especially because South American countries share similar problems and possibilities that can be tackled with collective enterprises, such as this one, that strive go beyond the borders erected by the deliberate ignorance of the others. Arqueolog\u00eda Suramericana/Arqueologia Sul-Americana is an international, peer reviewed journal published twice a year (January and July). The journal publishes papers on archaeology or related disciplines discussing issues whose geographical or geopolitical locus is South America.
