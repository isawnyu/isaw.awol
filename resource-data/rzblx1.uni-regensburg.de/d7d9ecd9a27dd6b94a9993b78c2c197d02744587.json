    "description": "[First posted in AWOL 23 May 2011. Updated 21 March 2015]. Interdisciplinaria Archaeologica: Natural Sciences in Archaeology (IANSA). ISSN: 1804-848X. The focus of Interdisciplinaria Archaeologica - Natural Sciences in Archaeology is the ongoing cooperation of archaeology with the natural sciences and other disciplines. The journal\u2019s interests include bioarcheaology (archaeobotany, archaeozoology, archaeogenetics and anthropology), geoarchaeology (petro-archeology, micromorphology) and dating methods in archaeology. We will publish contributions that aim to solve archaeological questions utilizing the methods of the natural sciences and other fields. The birth of IANSA reflects the growing need of scientists in central Europe to access an international journal focused on the methods of the natural sciences and multidisciplinary cooperation in archaeology. The growth of natural science methodologies within archaeology has been very dynamic. It is anticipated that our target group of readers will also grow in the coming years and, along with traditional archaeological institutions, will gradually include specialized natural science institutions (natural science departments associated with archaeology focused museums, specialized laboratories, etc. ) in the Czech Republic and abroad. IANSA also aims to provide a niche for historical studies, particularly those that cooperate with the natural sciences and archaeology. The journal is strictly scientific, peer reviewed, and publishes only in British English. Each article is reviewed by two specialists in fields related to the content of the article. Our goal is to establish IANSA as a high quality specialty periodical, cited by the international Thomson Reuters Journal Citation Report (JCR), and with a high level JCR \"Impact Factor\". A hardcopy of the journal is issued semi-annually, on glossy paper, and with an initial circulation of 500 pieces.",
