    "description": "The Art and Archaeology of Ancient Nubia. Peter Lacovara Emory University This course examines the development of the art and architecture of the cultures of ancient Nubia through what we have learned from archaeology and how that evidence has helped us create the picture we now have of the culture and history of the birth and development of art and civilization in the Nile Valley. About the Course The class will reveal one of the most dynamic, yet little known cultures of the ancient world. We will explore the geography and archaeology of Nubia, Egypt\u2019s neighbor to the south and home to a series of remarkable and innovative civilizations. It will cover the period from the earliest inhabitants of the Nile Valley (Paleolithic through Neolithic and domestication of plants and animals), and continue until the advent of Christianity.
