The California Institute of World Archaeology (CIWA) <blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><h2>The California Institute of World Archaeology (CIWA)</h2> The California Institute of World Archaeology was founded as a non-profit public benefit corporation in 1987 with the mission to apply new world computer know-how to the needs of old world archaeology.

All transactions are traceable. They show that these items were purchased from European sources between 1965 and 1975. The overwhelming majority of these items were regrettably removed from their context in the 19th century, and brought to Europe (sometimes as diplomatic gifts) without detailed provenance information.
