This project brings together images of major Talmudic manuscripts from libraries throughout the world. The manuscripts are indexed to enable access by standard citation (tractate, daf and amud for the Talmud Bavli, and tractate, chapter and mishna for the Mishna). As the manuscripts are entirely in Hebrew and Aramaic, the navigation tools of this site are in Hebrew. It is best viewed under Microsoft Windows with Microsoft Explorer version 5 or higher.",
