    "description": "Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies ISSN: 1084-7561 This journal is open to all bona fide scholars in Vedic Studies. It is monitored for style and content by the Editor-in-Chief. Our aim is to disseminate our work quickly. There is copyright but with automatic permission to publish anywhere else later on when the author wishes to do so. We include articles, abstracts, reviews, and news (such as on conferences, meetings, PhD projects of our students, etc.) We may consider a column of answers to comments on articles published in the journal, with final comment by the author (like the format used in Current Anthropology). by ================================= by ======================= ================== ======================",
