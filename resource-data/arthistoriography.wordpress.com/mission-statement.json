    "description": "Journal of Art Historiography. ISSN 2042-4752. The Journal of Art Historiography exists to support and promote the study of the history and practice of art historical writing. The historiography of art has been strongly influenced by traditions inaugurated by Giorgio Vasari, Winckelmann and German academics of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Consequent to the expansion of universities, museums and galleries, the field has evolved to include areas outside of its traditional boundaries. There is a double danger that contemporary scholarship will forget its earlier legacy and that it will neglect the urgency and rigour with which those early debates were conducted. The earlier legacy remains embedded in \u2018normal\u2019 practice. More recent art history also stands in need of its own scrutiny. The journal is committed to studying art historical scholarship, in its institutional and conceptual foundations, from the past to the present day in all areas and all periods. This journal will ignore the disciplinary boundaries imposed by the Anglophone expression \u2018art history\u2019 and allow and encourage the full range of enquiry that encompassed the visual arts in its broadest sense as well as topics now falling within archaeology, anthropology, ethnography and other specialist disciplines and approaches. It will welcome contributions from young and established scholars and is aimed at building an expanded audience for what has hitherto been a much specialised topic of investigation. Besides articles, it will accept notes, reviews, letters, bibliographical surveys and translations. It will be published every June and December and include both peer-reviewed and commissioned contributions. It will be the first contemporary journal dedicated specifically to the study of art historiography and its ambition is to make it the point of first call for scholars and students interested in that area. It is being supported by the Department of the History of Art at the University of Birmingham. In collaboration with Ashgate it also publishes Monographs in Art Historiography.",
