    "description": "[First posted in AWOL 18 August 2009. Updated 7 February 2013]. Topographical Bibliography of Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphic Texts, Statues, Reliefs, and Paintings. Series started by Bertha Porter and Rosalind L. B. Moss, assisted by Ethel W. Burney. Edited by Jaromir Malek. The Topographical Bibliography of Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphic Texts, Statues, Reliefs and Paintings now has eight published volumes (volumes i and iii in two parts, while volume viii will eventually consist of at least six parts).
