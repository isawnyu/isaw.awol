    "description": "Pegasus: Journal of the Department of Classics and Ancient History in the University of Exeter. Pegasus is the Journal of the Department of Classics and Ancient History at the University of Exeter. It was established in 1964 and is currently edited by a board of postgraduates. The journal focuses on multifarious aspects of the ancient world, the Exeter Department of Classics and Ancient History, as well as the Classical World in Devon. We aim to include a mixture of both the scholarly and the absurd (\u201cDifficult to tell which is which\u201d, an anonymous reader once commented). Regular features include pieces by staff and students, book reviews and interviews with people from the world of Classics, both within and outside the department. In addition, we welcome submissions from our readers. For alumni and former staff members, Pegasus is a great way of staying in touch with the department and keeping up with departmental news. For more details about our latest issue (no. 56, 2013) please click here. Past issues have included the Jackson Knight Memorial Lectures, articles by students including J. K. Rowling, contests, artwork and poetry. An index of previous articles is available on this site. Many of these issues are still available to order. As of 2013, you can also read all back issues (save those published in the last five years) as PDFs on our website. The Lawerence Shenfield Prize runner-up articles are also published on this website.",
