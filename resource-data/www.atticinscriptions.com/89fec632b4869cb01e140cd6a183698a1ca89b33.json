    "description": "AIO Papers (Attic Inscriptions Online). As this is the inaugural publication of AIO Papers, readers may welcome a word of explanation as to the purpose of the series. The primary objective of Attic Inscriptions Online is to make available English translations of Attic inscriptions, based on the most accurate and up-to-date Greek texts. The authoritative publications of the Greek texts are Inscriptiones Graecae vol. I (before 403 BC) and vol. II (403 BC - AD 267), new editions of which appear at infrequent intervals. When an inscription is included in a recently published volume of IG, such as the third edition of IG II (IG II3), the first fascicules of which appeared in 2012, identifying \u201cthe most accurate and up-to-date\u201d Greek text can be quite straightforward. In other cases, however, there can more of an issue. It can often be addressed by including one or more references to the review of epigraphical scholarship which is published every year in the Supplementum Epigraphicum Graecum (SEG). However, a simple reference to IG, SEG, or occasionally to another publication, is not always sufficient. SEG, for example, records textual proposals with a degree of indiscrimination which may mislead the inexperienced user. In the process of reviewing the textual literature while preparing a translation for AIO translators may see potential for textual improvements which require explanation and justification. The first purpose of AIO Papers, therefore, is to supply a forum in which the texts underlying the translations published in AIO may be clarified. Second, it is part of AIO\u2019s purpose to communicate Attic inscriptions to students and researchers who may lack the background knowledge, of the languages, culture and institutions of the Greek world in general, and of Athens and Attica in particular, that is needed to understand a translated inscription in its raw state. AIO Papers will publish essays intended to equip the user of AIO with such background knowledge. AIO Papers no. 4, to appear later in 2014, will be the first of this type: a companion to the translations of the inscribed Athenian laws and decrees of 352/1-322/1 BC, texts of which were published in IG II3 1, fascicule 2. AIO Papers will also publish other papers consistent with the objectives of AIO. This includes translations of important articles written by scholars in languages other than English but which, in the editor\u2019s opinion, deserve a wider circulation among an Anglophone readership. AIO Papers no. 2 and 3, translations of two papers originally published in Italian by Enrica Culasso Gastaldi, fall into this category. [From the Preface to.",
