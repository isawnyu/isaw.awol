Section C of the Proceedings publishes original research papers primarily in the fields of archaeology and history, although submissions in Celtic studies, linguistics and literature will also be considered. Papers should focus on Ireland or have a strong Irish relevance; submissions without an obvious Irish relevance may be considered at the editors\u2019 discretion, and authors should approach the editors before making such submissions. Scholarly editions of short historical documents of Irish origin or interest are also published.
