   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<span><a href="http://hieroilogoi.org/" rel="home" title="Hieroi Logoi">Hieroi Logoi</a></span>: Digital Resources for Religion in Late Antiquity<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">This blog is about the rich and bewildering variety of online  resources for the even richer and more bewildering variety of religions  in Late Antiquity.&nbsp; Hieroi Logoi, or “Sacred Discourses,” were tales of  great ritual and mythological importance, both written and unwritten,  from the Graeco-Roman world (the Mediterranean and its satellite  regions); Jews and Christians sometimes used this term to describe their  own scriptures.&nbsp; Hieroi Logoi were frequently intended for a restricted  community, but they also excited great interest outside the boundaries  of their intended audience.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">The purpose of this blog is to discover and review all websites  relevant to the study of the religions of Late Antiquity, here  understood broadly as the period between Alexander the Great (3<sup>rd</sup> century BCE) and Muhammad (6<sup>th</sup>-7<sup>th</sup> century CE). &nbsp;My goal is gradually to create a centralized information  portal on this subject, extensively categorized and tagged, for  scholarly research and teaching, as well as the interested public.&nbsp; Some  of these sites are well known, others obscure; some straightforward to  use, others difficult; some are well-funded collaborative efforts,  others are more informal.&nbsp; Caveat lector!&nbsp; But all have their interest.&nbsp;  If you have suggestions for sites to be reviewed, please contact me.</span></blockquote><br /><hgroup>   </hgroup>]]></content>
